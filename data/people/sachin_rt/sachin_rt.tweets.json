Keep firing it in guys... #INDvAUS It has been a wonderful World Cup hosted in Odisha! This tournament will definitely inspire many young kids to take up Hockey as a sport. All the best to the Netherlands and Belgium teams for the Final today. See you there. #HWC2018 #HumBhiHockey #DilHockey https://t.co/6VCpkwx8oC Many congratulations, @Pvsindhu1 for winning your maiden title at the BWF World Tour Finals. Wishing you all the best for the future. #BWFWorldTourFinals2018 https://t.co/US8NXCbALY Australia have got a very special spinner in @NathLyon421. He has got terrific variations and uses the pace and bounce from the pitch to extract maximum value. #INDvAUS Well played @imVkohli. One of your finest innings. This knock will be remembered for a long time. #INDvAUS https://t.co/Gj1dSN4k4p Heartwarming to see the entire nation supporting the Men's #HockeyWorldCup2018. Congrats @Naveen_Odisha @TheHockeyIndia for the world class arrangements. To extend my support, I\u2019ll be coming to the spectacular Kalinga Stadium tomorrow.

Have a wonderful year ahead. https://t.co/O1ffhKFwre @arvindtangadi Yes, Jadeja could\u2019ve played today but Hanuma Vihari could be expected to bowl a few overs of spin like we\u2019ve seen today. Will be answering a lot more questions on the #100MBApp. @100MasterBlastr I feel the wicket has quickened up a bit and as time goes by, it will only become harder and have more pace and bounce. #INDvAUS Australia played well in the first session and have surely been more positive today.\nIt\u2019s important for them to continue to bat well in the 1st innings of this Test to stay alive in the series, otherwise it will be a downhill ride all the way to Sydney. #INDvAUS All the best Team India, go out and do your best...Hum aapke sath hai!\n#HumBhiHockey #HWC2018 https://t.co/FxbKHXEdCV Many many happy returns of the day Thalaiva. Wishing you a healthy and blessed year ahead, @Rajinikanth Sir. \n#HappyBirthdayThalaiva https://t.co/4bftVuVpjL The spirit with which you have overcome every obstacle in life both on and off the field is the stuff of legends. Wishing a very happy birthday to the one and only @yuvstrong12! Have a great one.\n#HappyBirthdayYuvi https://t.co/GaMdWG6eUU What a way to start the series!#TeamIndia never released the pressure. Superb batting by @cheteshwar1 with crucial knocks in both innings, @ajinkyarahane88 in the 2nd innings and excellent contributions by our 4 bowlers. This has brought back memories of 2003. #INDvAUS https://t.co/4gmviaKeCC An emphatic win by #TeamIndia to beat Canada 5-1 and make their way into the quarter finals. Well done! #INDvCAN #HumBhiHockey https://t.co/UKn6c7OMn6 As of now, India is in the driver\u2019s seat and all set to take the game away. Australia need to bowl well in the first session tomorrow to stay in the game, otherwise they go to the next Test down 1-0. #INDvAUS Thanks @forbes_india for capturing my Second Innings thus far. The pitch is much beyond the 22 yards, the playfield has changed, the rules are different but the support of my team and well wishers makes this journey special. Looking forward to many more learnings and experiences. https://t.co/SWBZVWcRzH @vinodkambli349 It\u2019s been so many years since we\u2019ve known each other. However, not much has changed my friend. You continue to surprise me even today! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude1c #TeamIndia should make the most of this situation and not lose their grip. The defensive mindset by the Australian batsmen at home is something I\u2019ve not seen before in my experience. @ashwinravi99 has been very effective and has played a role to help the team be on top, for now. The game is wide open at this stage. The way the new ball is used in Australia in the first 15-20 overs is extremely crucial and could very well have an impact on which way this Test could go. #INDvAUS May this coming year fulfill all your wishes, @imjadeja! Happiest Birthday to you! https://t.co/XuHglSS8EO Happy Birthday, @Jaspritbumrah93! Wish you good health and happiness always!\n#HappyBirthdayBumrah https://t.co/ZcUo58Xvnc It was a gritty innings from @cheteshwar1 under the circumstances.

Spare a thought for their families as they have much to endure along with the players. Time for all of us to take a step back and give them some space. Cricket has been known as a gentleman's game. It's a game that I believe should be played in the purest form. Whatever has happened is unfortunate but the right decision has been taken to uphold the integrity of the game. Winning is important but the way you win is more important Cannot tell you how glad it makes me to know that you are following your dream. All the best for this challenging journey, @ArjunV_everest! #DreamsComeTrue https://t.co/OLndHWKBzG Thank you @KCAcricket for taking the right decision to move the ODI match from Kochi to Thiruvananthapuram.
