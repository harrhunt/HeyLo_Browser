Especially one that ain\u2019t run by us https://t.co/CqzHNipGWa I went through a lot of heart break the first half of my career, maybe even longer, cuz deep down I needed that validation that I thought the awards could bring. But it\u2019s a quote I\u2019m about to google that\u2019s the realist shit and sums up how I feel today. 4 anybody that need 2 hear i don\u2019t never wanna be propped up by tearing somebody else down. Seeing Cardi b win a Grammy make me feel like I won. Same with jay rock and Anderson. I feel for Travis cuz he really deserved that acknowledgement as well, but his moment is way bigger than the awards could say Coward and a terrorist. https://t.co/fqdrUmUgBC Bet then \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff  @KingOfQueenz  they ready for it. https://t.co/AWxtPKhfAu This my shittt.

How could we not.    https://t.co/78iYgX27Zw Lute - West 1996 pt. 2 https://t.co/uU99kLBb2l  \n\nLong time coming @lute_west9  \n\nNC shit, thank you. We hear you and we feel you. Ima stop it there. Peace and love to all, let's give energy to the solutions not the problem. Even if you don't rock with mine. Thank you Colin for your sacrifice. This may be the biggest opportunity we have ever been presented to come together and show the world and ourselves our true economic power. So when I think about it like that it's very easy on Sunday to say, \"Nope, I'm straight.\" Some of us got grandparents that walked miles to work instead of riding bus, just to show the bus companies that they won't tolerate racism It was hard during preseason and the first week. But then I was like, wait, is it actually hard? I respect whatever you decide to do. Watch or don't watch, whatever's in your heart. But I'm not watching til it feel right. Thats when the magic happens. And sadly, in this capitalistic world we live in, that's when your voice is heard. When you hurt the pockets. Repeat this with another company, and another. \"You know what, I don't think I can spend my money with you no more until you fix this.\" \"If not, why are you spending all this money with a League that clearly condones that? ... \" Pick one of the biggest ones and say, \"do you agree with black balling players when they speak out against oppression?\" So, next you turn your attention to these sponsors. Black people spend a lot of money with NFL corporate sponsors. White people who don't fuck with white supremacy spend a lot of money too. if a boycott doesn't force them to action, don't even trip. This is where the real flex happens. Well, you have a choice on how you respond to that. You can choose to not watch. Every day they stay quiet on this they're saying that they condone what's happening to Kap and the message it sends. Bare with me I'm just a rapper.. now look And compensate the man for his losses if they determine he was. Hire 3rd party investigator approved by NFLPA to determine if kap was denied a job unfairly as punishment for his stance.  (I know, I know) How do they make it right? I know there are people \nsmarter than me with better answers. But here's one. You and me have the power to deny them our attention ($$ to them) until they make a wrong situation right. Same ones who speak out against Trump today, are the same ones that denied a qualified man a job because he took a stand against injustice. Your eyes translate to advertising money for the League and it's owners. God bless every player that finds courage to kneel today. But the real power comes from you deciding to not watch. Got mad shit I shoulda tweeted over the months (or years?) but didn't. I'll do better. Now Ima need a thread 4 this next part. Bare w me Also Cardi b I seen your breakfast club interview, loved it. Don't put all that pressure on your album. You already won. Just drop &amp; repeat Thanks. Been gone too long twitter i missed too much shit. Never said thank you for the best tour. Thank you.
