I guess a little yoga helps too. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@whosdoctah Hank visits his mom at the cemetery. I had parallels in my own life that made it tough. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@kerrz123 Whatever Susan Downey says. Thanks for asking! #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@ina_IK Easy, be fully yourself. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@Reign_Fans You assume I'm not in possession of them ALL? #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@rdjfandom I hope not. Hank wins the day by sticking it out and developing faith. He sacrifices for the higher good. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@2thedreamers I don't know that I experienced embarrassment during production. It was a fruitful, harmonious group hug of a job. #AskRDJ .@rosefizzle_ Seek to understand rather than to be understood. Not easy, but well worth it. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@worldmarooner I've a deep respect for the process and more of an understanding of production. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@MadelynSilva I've seen worse and I'm still here. Bring it! #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@dickc Funny. I believe everybody winds up in the roles they're meant to do. Half of mine were turned down by others! #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@Alexx_xxelA Hank is a guy who's seeking salvation and doesn't know it, then finds it where he least expects. I relate. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@MechuReedusRDJ The same. Funny how my objectivity flew out the window. I let the movie take me on a ride. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@Janika__P I admire any man or woman who's up to the task. Lately, Susan is my hero. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@storyhookx @daxshepard1 and Billy Bob Thornton provided those. Lots of laughs. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@ainxsx Lately, I'm thinking Rome 4th century BCE. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@AMellenWrites People are saying it transcends the typical courtroom drama in that it's got pathos, humor and subplots. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@upanddowney_ \"Here comes the Pulitzer\"! (lol) #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@downeyobsessed @VeraFarmiga is delicious as Sam. I'd love to find something for us in the future. She's at the top of my list. #AskRDJ .@AishG_98 Usually I don't know it until I meet her or him. You never know how personalities will meld or clash. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@TwistinMixin They're both tough in their own ways. I found #TheJudge to be very uplifting, personally. Very proud that audiences love it. .@sharannxx At the beginning of the movie, yes. By the end, doubtful. Hank's #1 client would be someone wrongly accused. Tony rarely is! .@janet_phoenix Duly noted. Every mother-to-be is a Navy Seal and a saint. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@kenzleclaire Gifted, damaged, unrequited. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@tvd924grl \"Top of the World\" because your love puts me there. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@iamolliewilson There is great power in simplicity of approach. Process, not results. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@Ju_Ferrareto About the same. Pro is more creative control. Con is culpability for those decisions. #AskRDJ #TheJudge .@OUAT_fan96 One of them is the kitchen scene during the storm. Two lawyers go at it about the past. #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@Homegwarts In the last 24 hrs, a Nestle's crunch \"bite,\" and a Milky Way \"bite.\" #TheJudge #AskRDJ .@dxwney You might want to bring a kleenex or two, but most folks just go with it. #TheJudge #AskRDJ RDJ, open for the business of pleasure. #TheJudge #AskRDJ http://t.co/j4gVvmigHi In 1 hour please whisper \u201ctweet nothings\u201d to me using #AskRDJ. #TheJudge http://t.co/4bAFzJkacj Another true honor here at Club 21 w/ Dobkin, Duvall, @OfficialSting, Trudie, Floyd Abrams, and @DanAbrams. #TheJudge http://t.co/0KbRpbdBbx This weekend, you get to be the judge and jury.
