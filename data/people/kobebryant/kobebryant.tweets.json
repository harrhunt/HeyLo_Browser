And the lessons built within the story are the same disciplines and prinples that I try to instill in my daughters everyday. So excited for this project and for you all to experience the magical journey of #LegacyandtheQueen. As kids get older, we hope they\u2019ll start to understand the meanings and messages found in reading.

Ur avi and be funny without being disrespectful and I will gladly follow you. @James_Worthy42 @twcsportsnet @krambis Thx Big Game! I will be in the locker room with my guys thou @ILYKB24 yes. @lionelcoleman21 how could it? I'm sitting at home #thatsaillytalk. But I want the team focused on gm2, not this silly ish @Reckless831 thx bro but my dudes don't need the distraction   Period. @LAKERFANKEVIN88 I would but don't want my dudes having distractions plus some writers luv creating controversy so why give them the amo I see my tweeting during the game is being talked about as much as the game itself. Not my intention , just bored as I guess #notagain On to game 2. I will be watching from the crib again in a pau jersey and laker face paint ha! All jk aside We will be fine on wed #fanmamba @CountOnVic it was #nervesspeaking @CountOnVic @arashmarkazi if he kept his phone on so I could call him, I wouldn't have to tweet it LOL #imjoking #keepfocus #ontothenextone @AyyBeRaw ha! #nervousresponse I'm sure he didn't meant it that way #nobigdeal @DT_flash because I can't travel yet. Elevation from flight would cause swelling unfortunately. A fan?? Lol #microphonetalk @RealSkipBayless manu def had an impact on the games momentum. In gm 2 we gotta cut their penetration and post the ball more @PhilJackson11 will make sure the fellas r in line with that @PhilJackson11 I gotta do something. It's horrible not being able to at least be there with them. @RoCountsOnKobe 100%that's the key. Making adjustments. Chess not checkers Nothing worse then watching your bothers struggle and u can't do crap about it #realtalk Matador Defense on Parker. His penetration is hurting us @JoshuaBass91 get on block and make the game easier for ur guys Defensive transition on the bigs so we don't give up 3's to their guards @TaylorAshton17 yess sirr!! Gotta milk pau in the post right now and d12. Will get good looks from it @LakeShOwQueen he's the best power forward to play and my all time favorite to compete against #realtalk This game has a \"steal one\" written all over it for us @KatenSingler yea me 2!! Lol No telling what I might say! #rulechangescoming @LakerGangOrDie_ lot of correctable things. Lil strategic adjustments we can make Spurs hurt us with quiet 5-0/6-0 runs that kept us at bay @AlexLeeSays I can't travel yet. Altitude pressure causes swelling. Have to keep it elevated as much as possible @nbarocksstc I agree. Lethargic start for us. Gotta minimize little mistakes like giving up the middle drive on close outs Post. Post. Post. What I would say if I was there right now? \"Pau get ur ass on the block and don't move till u get it\" #realtalk @TheMontelShow spurs ability to change sides of the floor andget penetration is hurting us.have to pick up pressure,make them uncomfortable #redmamba haha I luv that @bkbb24 rhythm of the game. When it doesn't flow inside because of what the d allows we have to force the issue Gotta keep the spurs offense in front of our d. They r great at penetrating and pitching to their shooters Gotta get to the block. See wat spurs r gonna do with pau and d12 I like how Nash is moving so far. Both teams a lil out of rhythm to start Thank you @nike for this surprise spread in the paper this am. It touched me beyond words. #showuIwill http://t.co/AQtXLdeb31 #sexynurse shower prepping the leg for me. Can't get stitches wet but still gotta wash my ass\u2026 http://t.co/WGUwL2KRLo @yaz_jazz ha!

I literally sit with leg elevated all day and move just for potty breaks. @jackyhernande19 doing that now #scrolladdict @PressleyCarter sun maybe @Candace_Parker YUP I will probably tweet and follow more fans during the game on sun so if u wanna break the game down with me , tweet me #nostupidquestions \u201c@Amarina27: @kobebryant Les Mis.
