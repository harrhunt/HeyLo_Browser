Don\u2019t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we\u2019re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that\u2019s leaving a lot on the table @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq @torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in \u2206v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites.

Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere. @neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren\u2019t aware that orbit (and \u201czero\u201d gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space. @NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand.

Lot of fish to fry \u2026 @bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout. @cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you\u2019ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car. @tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too.

Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing. @DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat. @Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries.

We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn. @Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure. @Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I\u2019m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2 @Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward \u201cfin\u201d would simply be used as a leg. @Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3 @SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom. @SpaceXFan97 Yes.

The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win. @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That\u2019s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I\u2019m looking into it @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances. @Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world. @flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week.

Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval. @Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren\u2019t really meant to be \u201cTesla incentives\u201d, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all. @Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining. @justpaulinelol @31WA Hopefully, next year @slashdot Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8 @wonderofscience Sagan was awesome @Wikipedia They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your \u2026 along the Thames River in London https://t.co/P8SJGokLY8 @31WA Haha exactly! @Kristennetten Yes @GaryTheBot_ Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!

Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We\u2019re fixing that with Starship. @baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney\u2019s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you\u2019d exit on another continent. @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be \u201ccoach\u201d &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It\u2019s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands. @YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips. @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low @C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture. @ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability.

Swear these are legit technical terms \ud83e\udd17 @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It\u2019s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity. @Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor. @SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue. @engadget So cool @soswow @elontimes Anything with high contrast @teslaownersSV @elontimes Excessive shades of grey @elontimes Yeah, we\u2019ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous. @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps. @28delayslater @EvaFoxU Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week @EvaFoxU Haha @joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1. @DatKlow Chomsky sucks Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!! @Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven @HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done.

Maybe there\u2019s a good reason that isn\u2019t obvious. Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned? Over a million combustion engine (it\u2019s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question. Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?

Tesla won\u2019t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical. @kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months @frozencanuck Something like that Starting May 1 Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time RT @pmoconne: Took ownership of M3 1yr ago\n- 27k miles, not one issue\n- Increased range by 10 miles\n- Sentry/Dog mode\n- Summon\n- Arcade gam\u2026 @JCzolko Coming this year Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within 7 days for full refund) https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr @CryptoCobain Cryptocurrency is my safe word @Gfilche Model 3 drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k. @Katharina_Lamsa @Tesla @TheFuturist007 @SweMFA @HansLak @SPittWalker @antgrasso @AkwyZ @TopCyberNews Cool @Gfilche On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car RT @johnrobb: \u201cBuying a car today is an investment into the future.
