is what a climate emergency looks like. We must bring the full weight of the federal government to bear to help the people of California. We need to deal with the impacts that are already here and act decisively to prevent a much bigger catastrophe. https://t.co/Pmzw51rB4I RT @RepPressley: Community Health Centers play a critical role in fighting for health care justice for our most vulnerable communities. Thi\u2026 The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR\u2019s vision that he laid out 75 years ago.\n\nThese are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all. https://t.co/95W1GygZn5 Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was a murderer and terrorist responsible for terrible suffering and death. The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies. African-Americans are almost 4 times as likely to have force used on them by police\u2014this is unacceptable. The time is long overdue for us to end \"stop and frisk\" practices, demilitarize our police departments, and reform our racist criminal justice system. https://t.co/Wrw6o3Nsg8 The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than everyone else. In my view, this obscene inequality in wealth and political power is not compatible with a democratic society. I am proud to support the introduction of the For The 99.8% Act in the House by @RepJimmyGomez. https://t.co/DiLA5G1HgK How can we talk about problems of crime without mentioning that we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world? Building all the jails in the world will not make this right. https://t.co/H3In1bSUal Mr. President, this is the exact opposite of what halting endless war looks like.

That is a disgrace. Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:\n\n- $1.5 trillion from Medicaid\n- $845 billion from Medicare\n- $25 billion from Social Security\n\nThis budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people. This is a budget for the military-industrial complex, for corporate CEOs, for Wall Street and for the billionaire class. \n\nWe don\u2019t need billions of dollars for a wall that no one wants.

It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation. Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no \"national emergency,\" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval. The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a \"national emergency\" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!

That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.\n\nMeanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.\n\nI say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security. At a time when half of older Americans have zero retirement savings, we are not going to cut Social Security, as my Republican colleagues have proposed. We are going to expand Social Security and ensure everyone can retire with dignity. #ScrapTheCap https://t.co/m8fNoejkHD RT @SSWorks: Today, @SenSanders &amp; @RepPeterDeFazio are introducing the Social Security Expansion Act.

End of discussion. We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct Our health care system today essentially says that if you happen to be poor, you are less deserving of getting care than a wealthy person. That is fundamentally immoral and that is not the kind of nation we should be. Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that. How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage?

Watch this progressive economist @lenorepalladino explain to Trump's chief economist how large corporations use stock buybacks to enrich their shareholders at the expense of workers. https://t.co/htifnuklwi Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change. In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike 75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today. Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes. We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else. Trump is worried about America becoming a \"socialist nation.\" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country. What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour? Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud! While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded childcare.\nhttps://t.co/cFXY5NDboZ The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs. Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored. https://t.co/x4mMXk7liD Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people. The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry\u2014but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change. \n\nI believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy. Where did the money from Trump's \"tax cuts for the middle class\" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable. https://t.co/tsOvYYRekZ Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%. https://t.co/EDUd49hhmU Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it\u2019s wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public. I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign. President Trump. Do not shut down the government again.

This is not a \"hot economy\" when 62 percent of jobs in America cannot support a middle class life. https://t.co/ejTKgbkHmu Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.\n\nWe are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Yes, the economy is great\u2014for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. \"Our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the American experiment\u2014to do right by our people. And with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together.\" \u2013@staceyabrams https://t.co/PjBsW8rYBZ Trump talks a lot about \"freedom.\" But people are not truly free when they have no health care or can't afford to feed their families.

Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth.

President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation? Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight? Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, is correct that the money from stock buybacks \u201cdoesn't vanish.\u201d It increases the wealth of billionaires like him.

Two cents. Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short. Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia. After 35 days of pain and suffering for federal workers and contractors during the Trump shutdown, what's the first thing that the GOP leadership decides to do? Make the wealthiest families in America even richer. https://t.co/tEVU9TteWZ Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the INF treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We should strengthen these treaties, not end them. We should invest in our children, our seniors and our working families, not in an incredibly expensive arms race. The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little.

It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.

It is clear to me that S.1 would violate Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights. As a nation we have a choice: are we going to join every other major country and make health care a right? Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering? I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections. In the year 2019, no one in America, especially those working for profitable corporations with billionaire CEOs, should be living in poverty or struggling economically.\n\nWe must raise the minimum wage to a living wage\u2014$15 an hour. Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again. Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing. When an undocumented person commits a murder, Trump talks about it incessantly. When, in 2017,  a white guy like Stephen Paddock kills 58 people in Las Vegas and wounds 851, Trump has very little to say. Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by Hitler.

It is not a radical idea to say that instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the health care they have, we must join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system. \"When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.\u201d -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Riverside Church, 1967 Mr. President.

Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations. President Trump said that \"nobody has been better at the military\" than him.\n\nSo why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?

President Trump, you want to talk about crises?\n \n-30 million Americans have no health insurance\n-Climate change threatens our planet\n-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings\n-40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt President Trump, We don\u2019t need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds https://t.co/2aM2qTvp8w Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here: \nhttps://t.co/GDd8c2juru https://t.co/J4t1hVXR5A Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. https://t.co/MT8as5oOrf Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen. https://t.co/0pgB1GKHY3 97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA. \n\nWe need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now. https://t.co/Omb4mZBcgd We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.\n\nWe need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing. The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests\u2014drug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street\u2014who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.\n\nThey may have the money. But we have the people.\nhttps://t.co/DWNpsmQt9p There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump\u2019s government shutdown. https://t.co/K7L52eIj1w As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.\n\nThey're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.\n\nUnbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action. The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure.  We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%. https://t.co/cLtvP5zQOR Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is \"an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.\"\n\nEvery day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government. \n\nDemocracy should be about one person, one vote\u2014not billionaires buying elections. Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government. https://t.co/SngteGNDrL It\u2019s absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don\u2019t reopen the government. Let's get our priorities right. https://t.co/rHvpBHtHI5 Mr. President, I doubt very much that you can \u201crelate\u201d to federal workers. \n\nWhen is the last time you had to choose between paying your mortgage, feeding your family or putting gas in the car? \n\nEnd the shutdown. Pay federal employees. https://t.co/rHm3gpmPMz As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.  \n\nLeader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government. The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off.  https://t.co/p6m1ceBA5t If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country? \n\nPresident Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees. President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due. Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now. Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked \"the fraud of socialism.\" Really? I wasn't aware that it was \"socialism\" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started. Is it \"radical\" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so. I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I\u2019m confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way. https://t.co/frNh3rBPmw At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families. Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth. https://t.co/VVluA4R0v1 Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments. Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. \n\nWe're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose. We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly. As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year. Mr. President. Two children are dead because of your immigration policies. For once, be an adult. Stop blaming everyone else. Take responsibility for your actions. https://t.co/e1wkBkERAS Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change.  Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue? https://t.co/CDZ3xHw8Tj The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.\n\nWe must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections. If it is just \"bi-partisan politics\" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a \"radical\" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free? The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world. The American people are tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us. They want policies which work for all, not just the wealthy few. As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better. There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed. The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets\u201454% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. While Trump talks about a \"booming economy,\" the reality for working families is:\n-Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973\n-80% live paycheck to paycheck\n-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings\nNew Year\u2019s Resolution: Create an economy that works for all. Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors.  As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live. We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food. https://t.co/TmBFfbFE7m This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:\n-Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.\n-Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.\n- Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs. This president\u2019s erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern. https://t.co/02kkmG3cHU Think about it for a minute.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.\n\nAnd then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic. Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him. https://t.co/9KFRGWgatc \"I am proud to shut down the government...  I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\" \u2013@realDonaldTrump, last Tuesday https://t.co/yAAyB4yn8k If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don\u2019t think so! This is what happened:\n\n1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open\n2) The House was ready to pass the bill\n3) Rush and Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump\n4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas Last Tuesday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m proud to shut down the government.\u201d And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How\u2019s that for a holiday gift? Trump, the \u201cgreat friend\u201d of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.\n\nWhile Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks. https://t.co/cuMRN3C3po 85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.\n\nMillions more face the prospect of famine and death.\n\nThe U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it. Disgusting! https://t.co/zlyOm4LNMd Let\u2019s be absolutely clear about what Trump is doing with his latest food stamps work requirements rule: he is attacking the poor.\n\nWe should be expanding programs like food stamps that lift people out of poverty, not making them even harder to access. https://t.co/ZXsenxAaqn RT @jdakwar: .@SenSanders and @SenFeinstein ask not to sneak the Israel Anti-Boycott Act into the end-of-year omnibus spending bill.

HALF.\n\nImagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people. Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.\n\nWhat's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need. I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:\n\n-End cash bail\n-End private prisons\n-End mandatory minimums\n-Reinstate the federal parole system\n\nOur primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment. Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.\n\nHe lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.\n\nOur job: Repeal Trump\u2019s tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class.

He says that\u2019s based on assumptions by Senator Sanders.\u201d Wrong. Provider payment rates in our plan are not assumptions, they are written into the bill... 1) We correctly state that the Mercatus report found that the American people would save $2 trillion over 10 years under Medicare for All.

In response to the overwhelming public outrage at his policy of tearing children away from their parents at the border, this administration thinks the appropriate response is to indefinitely detain families. https://t.co/whZNxHzLHv Fact check: The Trump administration cannot keep their own story straight about the abhorrent practice of separating families at the border. Here is the truth about what's happening. https://t.co/psEFi7RbL5 When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal. To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win. The Acting Director of ICE can't bring himself to say that separating families is humane, yet he insists on continuing this horrifying policy. https://t.co/04w3zH7tcH Since 1990, 4 defense contractors (including Lockheed &amp; Boeing) spent over $714 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.

We will not allow Trump, Sessions or anyone else to continue a policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers. Together, we will defeat this inhumane and un-American action. The Trump admin, in its unabashed cruelty, is carving out a unique place in American history. It's not just support for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. They've hit a new low by separating kids from their parents and placing them in detention centers.

Over and over again, Republicans say we cannot possibly afford to make health care a right through a Medicare-for-all program.\n\nBut when it comes to spending $716 billion on the military, all of a sudden there's deafening silence from my Republican colleagues about the deficit.

That is a disgrace. Employee-owned companies won't provide starvation wages to workers and huge compensation packages to CEOs. They will not shut down and send their own jobs to China. In fact, study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, sales and wages. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies.
