I wish I could kiss and hug all of you for making this album and this tour so special. https://t.co/Hrw9GdIX1j To my army, my friends, my fans.... I love you so so so much. This year has been all about you and the new memories we\u2019ve made with these songs. At first they were my little secrets, and now they\u2019re bonds that bind us together in the moments we\u2019ve made with them. https://t.co/Uq7IPeoPnE thank you !! \ud83d\udc9c\u2728 #BRITs https://t.co/ewrjw9oPSt #1YearofCAMILA \ud83c\udf39 https://t.co/RxS9UWpiN0 I literally remember singing something\u2019s gotta give and having to take a bathroom break because I broke down crying #1YearOfCAMILA https://t.co/ytitDRzDIW All these years was written to acoustic guitar in like 15 minutes and then @frankdukes came in and did his thaaaaaang and made it sound all unique and moody #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/fzJqrqCRJw One of the themes of this album could be summed up in this sentence \u201cI hate LA, I have no friends here, and I\u2019ve been completely single for like 100 years\u201d #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/2WTlRPay1g I had some titles on my phone for a long time, like Havana and in the dark, but it\u2019s hard for me to like re use songs from other eras, because I think of album processes/ albums as the bookmark for a new chapter in my life so I can\u2019t go back #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/dk4k461d9w As far as singing, I literally resang Consequences at least 6 times #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/tnnhhJOBLx In the dark I wrote after going to a party in LA- in general I felt like I really wanted to get to know someone/ I really wanted any kind of connection that felt real- and nobody felt real to me, it just all felt surface-level #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/k4FRgWGRVw I\u2019m not saying anything till it\u2019s something I\u2019m comfortable with you guys tattooing on your bodies \ud83d\ude02#1YearOfCamila https://t.co/BsD7qEV47b A lot of this album was based on infatuations/ very minimal interactions I had people that I obsessed with enough to turn into songs. Like making a mountain out of a mole hill- in this chapter of my life, there\u2019s actually mountains ya know? #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/scel3xoSm7 100%, I\u2019m in a whooooole other chapter of my life now. Everything is different #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/omjvQPvXwC Because I\u2019m an idiot #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/UyOpSR3BsO By the time I put a song out Ive already moved on to working on other ideas- it\u2019s the making of it that excites me- once that\u2019s done I move on to making something else https://t.co/IuKRPhJjEz The hurting the healing the loving which some people got tattooed on their bodies \ud83d\ude29 #1YearOfCamila https://t.co/rzCsFtVO9O Never be the same. I just feel like that song sounds like what my soul sounds like. When I left the studio and played it in my car I felt like it was my favorite song I\u2019ve made #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/B1H1ZARyIV I wrote she loves control first as a title. for the first time in my life felt in control of my time, my life, and I think that all came from having control of my work honestly- we wrote the chorus to just guitar and then Skrillex came in and turned it around #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/x3ZKR3FMvW Hmmmmm #1YearOfCamila - ask me some questions about each song and I\u2019ll spill some tea \u2615\ufe0f https://t.co/YDflw0AV4z I remember this day like it was yesterday \ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/QNyxS6LKSX I love you guys, love scrolling through your tweets seeing all your favorite songs from the album #1YearOfCamila https://t.co/yli0g1N5IS Happy anniversary, fam.
