But when you work on yourself and bring your best self to something, I believe that\u2019s truly how to experience a love where you are bringing happiness and joy and not dependency. There\u2019s beauty in being your own source of happiness and fun and working on yourself. That\u2019s the process I been going through personally and it can be a scary thing. I never knew that I didn\u2019t know how to be alone in life. I always would find so much joy n happiness in a relationship or being with friends, but I didn\u2019t know how important it was to be in a relationship with yourself. Listen to your heart, it truly speaks to you! That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t always do even when I knew better I think at one point I stopped having fun with life and it became a burden, I know a lot of you feel that way too, if I felt that way doing what I always dreamed of. It\u2019s not suppose to feel like that and if it is then change it. @Jenn_19_ She\u2019s amazing! I didn\u2019t fumble anything but I can see from how things can look from the outside looking in. It\u2019s all love though, that\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand I been gone for awhile and barely on the internet, I learned so much about myself... I feel way more spiritually grounded. For the first time in my life I 100% believe in myself and that\u2019s something I\u2019m so happy I got to achieve in this lifetime...
