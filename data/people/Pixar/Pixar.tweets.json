I put together a reel which I have never seen and I\u2019m sure is terrible.\" (4/6) \"At the end of the CD-ROM, my boss came to me and asked, \u2018So what do you want to do?\u2019 I don\u2019t think they were expecting it, but I said, \u2018I\u2019d love to be an animator!\u2019 They shifted me over to animation as a PA.\" (3/6) \"But once I got here, I realized that there were so many aspects that made sense to me\u2014things that I had studied in performance that could be applied to animation, like acting, choreography, and movement analysis.\" (2/6) \u201cMy background is in performance and dance. I had moved to the Bay Area and ended up getting a job at Pixar as a PA. That was in 1996, and we were working on the Toy Story CD-ROM.

Helping to shape their character arcs from a female perspective was amazing and rewarding.\" (2/3) \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a female artist in this field. Women have to work harder to get the same recognition and respect that men do, but I don\u2019t mind that. I like to work hard.

I want to be like you and go to work at Pixar.\u2019\" (2/4) \u201cWhen my oldest son (who\u2019s almost 9 now) was about 4, he was very excited to tell me that he couldn\u2019t wait to be a mommy.
