Am ordering online kindergarten tutorials for help @SAfridiOfficial https://t.co/uXUSgxqZwK RT @MeghaSPrasad: He is brimming with ideas, rearing to go and he wants to make a real difference in East Delhi, catch @GautamGambhir on #R\u2026 I'm sure that the people of Delhi will reject this mockery of the poor, just like the people of India rejected 'NYAY' based on freebies and chose long term planning &amp; good governance of our Hon'ble PM @narendramodi ji. Poorer sections of the society need to be assisted by the Govt in every way possible. But arbitrarily deciding who's poor, what they want &amp; misusing public money right before election to fuel the ambition of 1 man is nothing short of a sin. Free WiFi is a laughable endeavour in this day &amp; age. Cheap tariffs for data have destroyed the demand for public WiFi. He could have invested in increasing no. of libraries with computers so that students with limited means could use them. But that requires long- term planning If Kejriwal &amp; Co. would have invested in improving public transport and had taken steps to ensure security of women in them, these gimmicks right before the elections would not have been required. He couldn't even fulfill his promise of having a Marshal in all DTC buses! Metro Man E-Sreedharan has stated that @OfficialDMRC still has an outstanding debt of \u20b935,000 Cr. Till this is not paid, freebies can damage the Metro project. According to experts, free metro rides would cost the public exchequer \u20b96.6 Cr/ day According to experts, the recently announced free electricity will cost the public exchequer 500-600 crores. Kejriwal has said that he restructured the current subsidy but has not given a single detail! Even if subsidy could be restructured, why did he do it now &amp; not before? This was the second hike ever since AAP came to power. The quality of water provided to people especially those living in the outer parts of Delhi is shocking. Delhi has been ranked last in water mgmt acc to a recently published report by @NITIAayog While constantly propagating free water to all, water &amp; sewer tariff was hiked by 20% for consumption of more than 20,000 liters/ month. This was done as @DelhiJalBoard suffered a loss of around \u20b9800 Cr b/w 2015-17 If @ArvindKejriwal &amp; Co. would have worked for welfare of people of Delhi as they claim everyday, need to entice them with freebies would not have arisen. Make no mistake, these freebies are meant to satisfy the thirst for power of 1 man and not help the downtrodden in any way May he remain in our hearts forever.

My humble homage \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/YACm56Fzbk I always looked up at the moon as a child, wondering what secrets it's hiding. The successful launch of #Chandrayaan2 will shed some light on these secrets, &amp; motivate the next gen to help India's space exploration programme. I congratulate everyone at @ISRO for this success. https://t.co/xy6aGt0xi3 RT @AkashvaniAIR: Golden Girl Hima! \ud83c\udfc5\nIndian sprinter @HimaDas8 clinched another Gold medal in 400 meter race with a season-best time of 52\u2026 I'm deeply saddened to hear about the untimely death of Sheila Dixitji.

A positive step in the right direction to get him home, and major diplomatic victory for India. Let's pray that he's home soon \ud83d\ude4f I want to voice my support to Shri @AmitShah for the deportation of illegal infiltrators in the country. I think this a vital step in the right direction to ensure that our resources are utilized to better the lives of all Indians. @HMOIndia https://t.co/pgi6qNwXnS @hvalecha @PMOIndia @narendramodi @dtptraffic I assure you that the concerned authorities are taking the right action, as you can see in the video from Nariman Vihar, Madhuban Chowk area. This also being a practical issue, I'm hoping that the sense of civic responsibility of Delhiites prevails. https://t.co/a0eQ2979hQ Don't understand how the game of such proportions, the #CWC19Final, is finally decided on who scored the most boundaries. A ridiculous rule @ICC. Should have been a tie. I want to congratulate both @BLACKCAPS &amp; @englandcricket on playing out a nail biting Final. Both winners imo. My heart goes out to the families of the three victims of the fire at Jhilmil Industrial area. The fire dept. are trying their best to extinguish the fire soon. I hope there is no more loss of life. I have also spoken to the concerned DCP for a full report on the investigation. I'm proud of the way @BCCI played at the @cricketworldcup . It's disappointing but that's the nature of the game. Well played @BLACKCAPS on a fantastic game and all the best for the final. Children are India's future, but @ArvindKejriwal &amp; @msisodia are playing with their education and their lives too. The fan which fell on Harsh's head at a GBSS is testimony to 'improved infra' being empty promises. I wish him a speedy recovery. https://t.co/SCD5oK7sr3 I have written to the hon'ble @LtGovDelhi requesting him to advise the concerned departments to prevent problems arising from unpreparedness for monsoons, and also the festival season approaching on the heels of monsoon. I've extended my support to help in any way I can. https://t.co/7R0WCkc7uj @hvalecha @PMOIndia @narendramodi @dtptraffic Thank you bringing this to my notice Hitesh. I have intimated the concerned department about your complaint, and have spoken to the local traffic inspector about the issue as well and they have assured me that necessary steps will be taken to resolve the matter. @prahladkumar58 That's the idea :) @jainsc53 Just trying to do what I feel can be done promptly to better the life of my fellow Delhiites Politics for me is a way to help the people of my city. My efforts will be to ensure that every penny I make as a MP will be used to better the lives of my constituents. That's why, I commit my salary to upgrade the cremation grounds with better facilities in East Delhi. @im_mahima Happy bday may u hav a great day and a great year ahead keep smiling always. Delhi is at epicenter of the country's groundwater crisis. And it's only getting worse. How have we reached this point? \n\nBy becoming aware today we can avert the danger tomorrow. https://t.co/Q8cdKJf4Yb Hey guys, thanks for sending in your questions. I appreciate your concern towards a better Delhi. You keep me focussed and accountable. I have tried to answer as many questions as I can today.\n\nClick on the link to see my responses: https://t.co/kEssb65TRx The inferno at the Directorate of Health Services building at Karkardooma is thankfully under control. I thank the Delhi Fire Department for their quick response in curbing the fire. I've spoken to the DCP, and thankfully there are no casualties. What surprises me most is that the entire @BCCI current selection panel had an unfulfilled career themselves!!!Even then they could not give a fair run to talent like @RayuduAmbati. What a shame!!! While it\u2019s important to win titles, guess it\u2019s more important to have a heart. Delhi is a part of who I am, and the people, part of who I can become.

I never had any control over their actions or lack of it in providing the customers with their flats. My sympathies were and will always be with d customers who had invested their money to buy these flats. As a responsible citizen, I will do everything possible to help them. Also, even as per the complaint, the allegations of wrong-doings are against the company and its promoters namely Mr. Mukesh Khurana and his wife Mrs.Babita Khurana who are the beneficiaries to the money received from the home buyers. ....and an Additional Director (for a short while), of the said real estate company named M/s Rudra Buildwell Realty Pvt. Ltd. Maybe this is the price I\u2019ve had to pay and it seems that some vested interests and publicity mongers joined in to publicize the news. I was always represented by my advocates in the Court, as I am more than willing to abide by the law of the land and honor the directions issued by the Hon\u2019ble Court. On another note, I would like to clarify that I was merely a Brand Ambassador... Since last evening there\u2019ve been media reports about bailable warrants issued against me for not appearing before the Court.I\u2019d like to clarify that dates for appearance in Court coincided either with my playing commitments for Delhi Ranji Team and/or other professional reasons.

No better inspiration dan a young man sacrificing his life 4 his country. My worry is dat our leaders can neither control d mosquitoes which r within d nation nor which cme frm acros d border.
