For #InternationalWomensDay, I'm issuing you a challenge. \n\nWe know that when women run for office, they're elected at the same rate as men. \n\nBut not as many women run as men\u2014often because people don't ask women to run as often as they ask men. In other words: Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights. Period. \n\nCall your members of Congress today and ask them to support the Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act: (202) 224-3121 #ReproRightsAreHumanRights By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election. Women's reproductive rights are human rights that are universal and indivisible. \n\nGovernments do not get to pick and choose whose rights and which rights will be respected. I introduced reproductive rights sections to the reports while I was secretary of state because access to reproductive health care is a protected human right affecting women's right to life, equality, and freedom from inhumane treatment. Her U.S. asylum officer opens up the State Department's human rights reports and finds no information about those 17 women imprisoned for miscarrying or El Salvador's abortion ban. He deems she has no credible fear of persecution if she returns home. He denies her application. Imagine how this can play out. A woman living in El Salvador, where abortion is banned, is raped and becomes pregnant. She suffers a miscarriage and decides to flee the country knowing that 17 of her countrywomen were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after miscarrying. Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicant's fear of persecution. Human rights reports that contradict an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application. Human rights advocates, lawmakers, academics, businesses, NGOs, and other institutions all over the world use the reports to inform their work as well. Some background: \n\nAll branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security. Important legislation introduced yesterday: The Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act would correct the Trump administration's dangerous decision to remove reporting on reproductive rights from the State Department's annual reports on human rights practices around the world.

There was a 10-point increase in youth turnout from 2014 to 2018, due in part to the hard work done by @Alliance4Youth. More than 30% of young people voted in 2018! In Chicago, young people outperformed all other generations on Election Day for the first time ever. Five @EmergeAmerica alumni are headed to Congress, and 145 were elected to state legislatures. Emerge alums also helped put an end to the Republican supermajorities in the Michigan and Pennsylvania senates. For many campaigns, @SwingLeft was the wave. On average, for their top 15 campaigns, Swing Left drove more than 50% of their canvassing shifts. More than 60,000 volunteers knocked an estimated 5 million doors and made 2.5 million phone calls. In 2018, @LatinoVictoryUS increased their endorsed candidates 500% over the previous year. Of their 58 candidates, 43 candidates won, bringing their 2018 win rate to a whopping 74%. The number of Democratic Latina members of Congress nearly doubled. In two years, @RunforSomething has recruited 28,000 young, diverse progressives who want to run for office and elected more than 200 of them to local office in 40 states. In 2018, their candidates were 3 of the 12 Texas House pick-ups and 3 of the 11 Florida House pick-ups. .@ArenaSummit supported 54 candidates in the 2018 election cycle, and 27 of their candidates on the ballot won their elections.

In Texas, where Voto Latino has had a program since 2010, early votes surpassed 2014 totals by 149%. .@ColorOfChange PAC\u2019s #VotingWhileBlack program reached more than 5 million voters, and now African Americans have a new cohort of officeholders at both the local and state level. Three candidates that @iVoteFund supported for Secretary of State won\u2014all pick-ups, all young women, all Democrats. And they were able to raise and invest $7 million in Secretary of State races, their most ever. .@CollectivePAC helped elect over 54 African Americans to local, state and federal offices, trained over 300 operatives and staff through the Black Campaign School, and engaged over 1.5 million black voters. Nine @IndivisibleTeam-endorsed candidates won. Overall, the margin in their endorsed races swung 8 points to the left. Among races rated \u201cSolid R,\" that swing was 15 points.

It's a fundamental building block of democracy that elected representatives respect the outcome of elections. To ignore those outcomes is to silence voters and endanger the health of our democracy itself. In Michigan, voters chose Democrats to be governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Since then, the Republican-controlled legislature has passed bills to gut minimum wage, slash paid sick leave, and limit the new secretary of state's powers. https://t.co/P979PIvCrY Over the last few days, Republicans in Wisconsin's state legislature have pushed through bills to shift power to their Republican-controlled legislature and away from the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. https://t.co/V7pUkwpujH Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin lost elections on Nov. 6. Rather than respect the will of voters, they're using their last few weeks in office to pass laws limiting the power of new governors and put roadblocks on voting. It's not just anti-Democratic.

You can read it in full here. https://t.co/80nvf1fjSg Of course, combating climate change is about more than dollars and cents. It's a moral imperative. Our children and grandchildren deserve to live on a planet that can support their lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. \"Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and favorable climate conditions, such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, are vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change.\" \"More frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities.\" \"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century\u2014more than the current GDP of many U.S. states.\" The Trump administration tried to bury a federally-mandated climate change study by releasing it the Friday after Thanksgiving. Here's what they didn't want you to hear: This is wrong. https://t.co/umrKs9CBeK Democracy hangs in the balance on both sides of Atlantic and we need to save it. Can\u2019t just keep doing the same things. \n\nFor more, check out my Oxford speech: https://t.co/J4cgHCmcZN In Europe, nationalists like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban are exploiting this challenge to stoke fear and resentment. To defeat them and protect democracy, the EU needs a more comprehensive policy that builds societies that are both secure and welcoming. On both sides of the Atlantic, we need reform. Not open borders, but immigration laws enforced with fairness and respect for human rights. We can\u2019t let fear or bias force us to give up the values that have made our democracies both great and good. In a recent interview, I talked about how Europe must reject right-wing nationalism and authoritarianism, including by addressing migration with courage and compassion. I also gave a comprehensive speech about this last month. Trump has made it worse with cruel abuses at the border, detaining children and separating them from their families. It\u2019s one of the most shameful moments in our history. We passed bipartisan comprehensive reform when I was a senator, but House Republicans killed it. Since then, the GOP has refused to make progress and instead uses the issue to divide our country. and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy, fixes the family visa backlog, upholds the rule of law, and protects our borders and national security. I have always been and remain a staunch advocate of comprehensive immigration reform that\u2019s true to our values and treats every person with dignity, provides a pathway to full and equal citizenship\u2026 May we all open our hearts and reach across tables today. May we all find hopes and values in common. May there be pie. Happy Thanksgiving.

Win or lose, what you've built will continue long after last night. None of these victories would have been possible if people had simply given up after the heartbreak of 2016. They belong to all the volunteers and candidates who worked impossible hours, logged hundreds of miles, and knocked on countless doors. There were important wins for rights, too, including Floridians voting to restore the voting rights of 1 million of their fellow citizens and Nevada approving automatic voter registration. These historic firsts are important not just because representation matters (and it does), but because these extraordinary women will bring perspectives that have been absent from our policy debates for far too long. The inspiring Lucy McBath became an activist for common-sense gun reform after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. This cycle, she ran for Congress in a heavily Republican district in Georgia\u2014and it looks likely she will win. Janet Mills will be the first woman governor of Maine. Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer will be the first women to represent Iowa in the House. Finkenauer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are the youngest women to be elected to Congress ever. Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes will be the first black women to represent Massachusetts and Connecticut in Congress, respectively. Tish James will be the first black woman to be New York's attorney general. Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will be the first Native American women to ever serve in Congress. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the first Muslim women to serve. It was a historic night in so many ways: For the first time ever, over 100 women were elected to Congress\u2014including a record number of women of color. Congratulations to all the voters, volunteers, organizers, and candidates who voted last night to put a powerful check on this administration and start building a better future for everyone in our country.

Republican lawmakers justify such laws because they protect against \"voter fraud.\" But \"voter fraud\" has been proven in study after study to be a virtually non-existent problem, with incidence rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent. https://t.co/5brRSX9VjW In Texas, groups like @TXCivilRights and @MOVE_Texas argue that officials' decision to limit early voting at college campus sites specifically targets students. https://t.co/625R7066vz Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is overseeing his own election for governor and has put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, 70% of them from black voters, because they don't adhere to an \"exact match\" standard of name spellings. https://t.co/winbxiHNjl In this cycle, Native Americans are scrambling for IDs because of a new voting law that requires them to use identification that lists a street address rather than a P.O. box, which many who live on reservations have used for years. https://t.co/z008t65PIt Fast-forward a few years: 24 states have put new voting restrictions in place since 2010, including photo ID rules in Alabama, \"use it or lose it\" laws in Ohio, and \"exact match\" laws in Georgia. First, some history. The 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby v. Holder gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states with a history of voter suppression no longer needed the federal government to approve changes to voting rules. Let's talk about voter suppression, how you can protect your rights in this election, and how we can fight to make America a place where every citizen can make their voice heard. Reproductive rights are human rights\u2014all around the world. https://t.co/asOM89aS7J It was wonderful spending time in Florida yesterday campaigning with some familiar faces.

The budgets and walk lists are smaller than those of congressional races, so you can move the needle with a few volunteer hours or donations. Winning back state legislatures is also important in this last election before the 2020 Census. State legislatures redraw congressional districts every 10 years based on those numbers, and Democratic legislative majorities can shut down gerrymandering that disenfranchises voters. State legislatures with Democratic majorities can help preserve access to the ballot for people of color, reproductive freedoms for women, the rights of LGBTQ people, protections for immigrants, Medicaid expansions, and more. A reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights\u2014especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us.

They told me about their grief, and also about their anger and frustration toward a political system that couldn\u2019t seem to take action to prevent other kids from dying from unnecessary gun violence. Some of the most painful and rewarding conversations I have had on the campaign trail were with parents who had lost their children to gun violence.

Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families. We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and\u2014you won't be surprised to hear my support for this\u2014abolishing the Electoral College. Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixon\u2019s abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules. First: We\u2019ve got to mobilize turnout in the midterms. There are fantastic candidates all over the country who\u2019ll do great things, and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House. With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Here's how. Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office. We should be clear about this: The increasing radicalism and irresponsibility of the Republican Party, including decades of demeaning government, demonizing Democrats, and debasing norms, is what gave us Donald Trump. There is a tendency, when talking about these things, to wring our hands about \"both sides.\" But the truth is that this is not a symmetrical problem. Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then there's the breathtaking corruption. On the day after the election, I hoped my fears for our country's future were overblown. \n\nThey were not.

Meanwhile, 96 Americans are killed with guns every day. \n\nCall your senators: (202) 224-3121 \u201cGun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in the text, history and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right,\" he added. Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. appeals court ruled in 2011 that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration. He argued that courts shouldn't consider the public safety benefits of gun laws: \"Our task is to apply the Constitution.\" Let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh's past rulings on guns. He's out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures' public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they don't align with his politics. The administration is now seven weeks late in meeting its deadline to reunite families they separated at the border. Hundreds of families have spent the past seven weeks waiting and worrying. There's no possible excuse for continuing to keep them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether Congrats to the great @barb_kinney on her new book collecting her photos from the campaign trail in 2016.

We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country. \n\nPlease call your senators and relay the message: (202) 224-3121 Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" He said he was not. Because there are none. Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. It's an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society. When Kavanaugh called birth control \"abortion-inducing drugs,\" he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too. Kavanaugh didn't use that term because he misunderstands the basic  science of birth control\u2014the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it's a dog whistle to the extreme right. I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as \"abortion-inducing drugs.\" That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too. May we always remember those we lost 17 years ago. May the love, bravery, and selflessness so many showed that day light our path forward. RT @voxdotcom: When women are paid less for doing the same work as their male peers, it affects us all. \n\n@HillaryClinton weighs in for thi\u2026 This took courage. Thank you, David, for speaking out. Now let\u2019s turn to the future and mobilize people for the midterms. https://t.co/hwGjqLVCEu We're not fighting for the planet in some abstract sense here. We're fighting for our continued ability to live on it. \n\nCall your senators: (202) 224-3121 Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA's attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority. In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a \"thin statute\" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants. Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants. During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years\u2014maybe decades\u2014that we can\u2019t afford to waste on inaction. Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were \"well within\" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions. Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up. This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida. \n\nIt's urgent that we act to curb climate change\u2014and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court could make progress virtually impossible. Six weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families, 497 children are still waiting.\nhttps://t.co/CoXkLvykTR Want to run for office or join a campaign but unsure of how to get started? \n\nIf you're near Philadelphia, consider attending the @ArenaSummit this weekend. It\u2019s a gathering for the next generation of civic leaders: \n\nhttps://t.co/fnJIBJdosT This fight isn't over until it's over, and the only thing we can count on in this era is that these battles won't always end the way we expect they will. \n\nShare the number of the Senate switchboard with a friend right now: 202-224-3121 Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those. The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaugh's record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression. Voter fraud\u2014the justification for voter ID laws\u2014has also been proven to be a virtually nonexistent problem. A recent Brennan Center report noted that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls. https://t.co/gW9sf5QNRB He wrote approvingly of \"recent changes to voting laws\" that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color. Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters. Today's reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots. If you agree, please pick up the phone right now and call your senators. Ask them to #StopKavanaugh: (202) 224-3121 One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one's own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures. It's remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights. Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a woman's right to make her own health decisions. Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control. As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion. A few weeks before Kavanaugh's name appeared on President Trump's short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his \u201chero,\u201d noting that \u201che clearly wanted to overrule Roe.\u201d If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will. This is as serious as it gets. It's up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans\u2014again. \n\nAs Kavanaugh's hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: (202) 224-3121 Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators' votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades. Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch. In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier. The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows he\u2019d be a threat to the law. Challenges to the Affordable Care Act's protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies can't refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts. Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? \n\nThen you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Here's why: https://t.co/zgqwfdwTsF Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. \n\nWe can't afford more damage to workers' rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Let's #StopKavanaugh. In 2016, Kavanaugh held that corporations have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars. In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer. In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively. In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaugh's record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows he'd help further that trend for a generation. The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts. That ruling won't just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. It'll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too. The Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts don't have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if they're not members. The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people. Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers\u2019 rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed. Vladimir Putin has waged a 30-year campaign to disrupt world events, including our last election. I talked about it in @ActMeasuresDoc, a fascinating summation of the Russia story that premieres today: https://t.co/E0t1JeSssA Today's celebration of Aretha Franklin's life was like the lady herself: Joyful, profound, and full of song.

It is now the official policy of the US government - a nation of immigrants - to separate children from their families. That is an absolute disgrace. #FamiliesBelongTogether. He said that \u201cIn the immigration context, the government has never taken a stand against the protection of kids in this country. For the first time, it is now formally taking a position that explicitly goes against the best interests of kids.\u201d Muzaffar Chishti of @MigrationPolicy said something that has stuck with me. Not only that - this administration built on their \"zero tolerance\" policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks. We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, it\u2019s devastating to even imagine. Like so many others, I am horrified and heartbroken by what is happening to immigrant kids and families because of this administration\u2019s disastrous policies. Too many American children will never have the opportunity to realize their dreams because their lives were cut short by a bullet. Our kids deserve to live free from the threat of gun violence. #WearOrange @Everytown @MomsDemand https://t.co/SjacOKPgVv More than 4,600 lives lost in Puerto Rico. 70x the official number.

So in these surreal times, let\u2019s rally together &amp; take action.  Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor &amp; vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it\u2019s the very least they can do. How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations &amp; the ultra-wealthy, Republicans can\u2019t find the time &amp; money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s. It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid &amp; now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex &amp; paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. That\u2019s what Congress is doing w/ your tax dollars. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids &amp; has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago. There\u2019s a lot to be frustrated by right now, to say the least.

Congratulations to @RunforSomething founders @amandalitman + @RossMoRock for a huge night! 25 of the local candidates they helped to recruit and run won.
