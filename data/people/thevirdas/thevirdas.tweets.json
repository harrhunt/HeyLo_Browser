Fun fact to give you hope: while filming the special this weekend we sealed over 2000 cell phones. People did without their phone, locked in a pouch, for about three hours and were fine.

To me...thats the Bandra song now. @SaketGokhale Cool...i might be tweeting tomorrow...clear your schedule :-) @SaketGokhale Ill keep it on my timeline...where you found it in the first place.....bye now sunshine :-) @SaketGokhale Also.......i tweeted about a hug. Literally a hug. When you take three year old tweets and screenshot them out of context, all this nonsense...you'll get chilled responses from me. But you're no better than the IT cell trolls we all despise. Put something positive into the world. Doing the Secret Set at Sophia today.  We're sold out.

I don't know who is out there milking these almonds....but I thank them and their tiny hands. Here's what you should understand. I'm not anti-modi or pro-modi and neither is anyone normal. Most of us are pro policy and anti policy. Modi is not the first PM in our life and he won't be the last. I'll focus on the next PM with jokes too like I did the last. That's democracy. https://t.co/Iyga6mMPMv There's something humane and  beautiful about an Isro chief breaking down and a Prime Minister hugging him.

I think proud fanatic people of any religion deserve their own dedicated food delivery app.....and social media apps......and preferably....their own internet. I'm very upset. I ordered food from an online app and specifically asked that my delivery person be a Scientologist. I cancelled the order when he wasn't. I'm very hungry, was looking forward to eating those crazy pills. Flying Aer Lingus. Listening to the announcements and laughing. Because....Lingus. \n\nAlso...I'm twelve years old apparently.

No souvenirs, no clothes, no expensive toys or gadgets. But travel well, stay in nice places, eat good food, watch great artists, read amazing things. And it's been kind of life changing.

Well it's hard to support those who can't support themselves.\n\nSo does that make me NOTA? That's not exactly useful. I believe voting is incredibly important. Here's the truth. \n\nNot supporting the Congress doesn't make you a BJP supporter. I don't like theft, doesn't mean I like being intimidated and controlled. \n\nNot supporting the BJP doesn't mean you support the Congress. Infact I blame the Congress for the BJP.

You're not that popular, and not that inspiring either. \n\nI don't hate Modi. I give him my taxes and don't really think about him beyond that. \n\nI succeed because of hard work, not luck.\nCheers! https://t.co/xKgQdjebDj Wrapped shoot earlier than planned  today.

Get tickets to #TheLovedTour here: https://t.co/ZyVVpHcH1P https://t.co/KRcQkXHFiP Ostriches aside....anyone think it's ironic that Nirav Modi was found because of a 'Hide Jacket'? American character, American accent....or at least my best attempt at one. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/1k4nCGAsFt Just once I'd like to read an article about a female comedian that doesn't talk about all the 'taboo' topics she talked about. She doesn't think they're taboo, neither should you. Maybe I'm wrong, but the more you label her setlist taboo, the tougher you make it. This just makes me smile \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/EfjUU4qgGu @SanSip Hahahahahahahaha! THIS SUMMER.....ACTION.....DIAMONDS....ALOPECIA....REDEMPTION....#NIRAVMODI....IN...suggest title below.... How about this as a plot:\n\n#NiravModi is arrested by four undercover RAW agents. They take him to an underground room. \n\n\"Mr Modi, you know diamonds, and you're already in london. If you can get the Kohinoor back, all is forgiven.\"\n\nCue rock music to set up heist prep montage. My first thought when I heard \"We know #NiravModi lives in a flat that costs over 40 crores\" was...wait...he's in Colaba? My equivalence isn't false and it isn't ambivalent equivalence either. It's active disdain for two major parties, neither of which I feel deserve to run my country because they are too busy trying to pull each other down rather than build us up. https://t.co/065woWqNZx Here's a little truth. \n\nEverytime I tweet something about the BJP,  Congress leaders and handles RT me. When I tweet about the Congress, BJP leaders and handles RT me. \n\nAnd the fact that they need a comedians tweets...makes me lose respect for both of them. How long do you think it will be before Republic TV claims to have exclusively found Nirav Modi in London? \ud83d\ude42 The moral of the story is this...\nNo matter how hard you try... \nNo matter how much ostrich skin you wear.....\nIt's hard to get a cab in London. \n#NiravModi I don't know if you noticed, it's was kinda subtle, but Nirav Modi has no comments.

We haven\u2019t left for London yet. Thanks @British_Airways Some of us are starting to set up tents and we are thinking of building a school for the young \ud83d\ude42 Now been on board for three and a half hours with no real info. @British_Airways Captain keeps telling us we will be de-iced. But the icing on the cake is your system says we left on time and arrived too \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/MDtSZWPIIp Hey Neil. I\u2019m with 200 passengers stuck on your plane right now. We\u2019ve been here on board for about 2.5 hours. We keep getting told we\u2019re about to be de-iced every half an hour. It\u2019s like fyre festival. But on a plane \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/eDxLoUq3NO Between Hasmukh, Other projects and Whiskey Cavalier. Have spent eight months acting.

Either way....Thappad. https://t.co/QcfO42ir3c Chapelle. No doubt. https://t.co/73XECMCocW Fun fact. Never use face products. Only ever use aloe Vera gel.

Questions can be about anything at all. Let\u2019s hashtag it #stuckinaplaneAMA Been sitting on a plane for two hours waiting for a blizzard to calm down and a plane to get de-iced. If you\u2019ve got questions...ask em! https://t.co/tEt2AzIgUD @British_Airways Now on my way from Prague to Heathrow on BA861....possibly writing some jokes about how much you suck \ud83e\udd17 Thanks guys. @British_Airways After 90 mins. Get to the gate. \nBusiness seats available. \nAgain offer to pay. \nRefused. \nStaff rude again. \n\nThanks guys \ud83d\udc4d\nYou\u2019re keeping it friendly! @British_Airways I said I was willing to pay for my seat. You say you gave them all away. \nThere were seats readily available when I sat on the flight. Your staff was rude and offensive. \nEventually said \u201cYou want to get on the flight or not?\u201d Dear @British_Airways enjoy this story. \nBought a business ticket on your Prague London flight. \nYou cancelled it. \nOffered to buy a new ticket on business on the next flight. \nYou made me stand at transfer desk for 90mins. \nThen said economy only. \nContd. Snowed in portrait. https://t.co/NGMpwdWgXL Prague to londinium. This airport is snowy as fakkkkk! https://t.co/ekvtb88hgm No matter who you support. Let's start thinking of elections as us asking for the things we want, asking politicians to get behind us, rather than just getting behind the things politicians want. Not true. I like chicken wings and pork chops too. https://t.co/9J63XJs2Tv RT @s_brownie: @thevirdas excited to see you on tv !!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d @ABC  #whiskeycavalier #abc https://t.co/ffeErOyHLx You happy?\n\nhttps://t.co/sNmBkxB0zR RT @tipnism: Finally got around to watching @thevirdas\u2019 Losing it. Great work! It\u2019s deeply thoughtful - embodies a lot of the new Indian th\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure highly effective people don\u2019t have time to tell you their habits. Leave alone seven of them. Man, some people here been throwing shade so long...you\u2019re basically shadows. Transitioning from one project to another. Got a month. Lose bulk. Grow moustache. Grow hair. \nBut on the bright side....no more gym for a bit \ud83d\ude42 Suit up! https://t.co/cwnLGmc7eH Inside the Mossad. What a fascinating watch! There's a LOT of people asking me about the song at the end of #LosingIT and i wish I could tell you it was a poignant piece of rock. Truth is it's me and my band Alien Chutney singing about Manboobs...many many years ago!\nhttps://t.co/F78sObuDaB @TylerJamesWill Damn! Amazing! https://t.co/eJabC1ftNV When you're convinced no one is able to smell or hear it.....when you think you've gotten away with it.... https://t.co/RFdV15n9WS I want to be one of these people who can get away with saying 'Yasssssss'.
