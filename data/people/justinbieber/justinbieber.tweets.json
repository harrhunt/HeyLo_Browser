Today is a good day When are we gonna be the kind of people that find joy in adding value to one another and not tearing each other apart.. And rather than try and make people feel accepted and loved you find things to pick apart like the world isn\u2019t full of that already.. we can find something negative to say about anything or anyone And rather than being positive you belittle people. Think about how awesome it felt for me to be on that stage after being away for so long the excitement and joy it gave me doing the thing i love the most, i sang to to backtrack like most cameos do this is a normal thing, @Morgan_Stewart imagine if you spent even half the time you spend laughing at other peoples expense actually building people up and encouraging people how much positivity you could bring. What hurts about this is the fact that you have a platform to make a difference @Morgan_Stewart just saw a video of you ripping me to shreds saying I was lip-syncing. They played the song and i just sang overtop of it.. regardless why spend your time tearing people down. It\u2019s People like you that are bullies at school that are making kids suicidal.
