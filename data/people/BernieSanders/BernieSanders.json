We stand against all kinds of bullying and will fight to end discrimination in all its forms. #SpiritDay I hope you can join me and @AOC at our rally in New York this weekend and help us show the strength of our movement. RSVP here: https://t.co/nyqtMVEcXQ Jailing people for the \u201ccrime\u201d of getting sick is immoral, unconscionable, and un-American.

End of discussion.\n\nIf employers refuse to negotiate in good faith, we will impose strong penalties on those companies. It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All.\n\nUnder our plan, funded in a progressive manner, all Americans will have comprehensive health coverage as a guaranteed human right with no out-of-pocket expenses. https://t.co/m52Vtid3Dw Not only is Trump using the powers of the presidency to enrich himself, which is blatantly unconstitutional.\n\nHe is ignoring a massive international crisis that threatens humanity.\n\nWhat a disgrace. https://t.co/bpeZlVwzua This takes real courage.

I have a message for Donald Trump: no, we\u2019re not going to hate Latinos, we\u2019re not going to hate Muslims, we're not going to hate immigrants. We are going to stand together and refuse to let you divide us up. Congratulations to the members of @SEIU73 at the Chicago Park District on winning a tentative agreement that values their important work. \n\nWe stand with SEIU and @CTULocal1 members at Chicago Public Schools who are fighting\u2014and striking tomorrow if necessary\u2014for the common good. https://t.co/s2dqOPpOrl Happy #NationalBossDay to the 10 million workers in nearly 7,000 employee-owned businesses.

When politicians like Trump say we must cut food stamps, Medicaid and public housing, it's not because we don't have the money.\n\nWe're the richest country on Earth!\n\nIt's because they refuse to stand up to their billionaire donors, who hoard wealth and stash it in tax havens. No person needs to have tens of billions of dollars while others sleep out on the streets. We're going to tax the ultra rich and use the revenue to guarantee decent housing for all. Mental health care shouldn't be a privilege for the wealthy. It should be accessible to all. Medicare for All will guarantee mental health coverage to every person in this country, free at the point of service. #WorldMentalHealthDay It's not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made $1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.\n\nOur system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.\n\nWe need Medicare for All.

Not only are we going to defeat Trump, we're going to make him pay an additional $142 million with our tax on extreme wealth. When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.

It is economically necessary. https://t.co/TdvIUxeQ2f Trump's vision of government is one that serves the rich and attacks the poor. We have a different idea.

I'm in stage four. I can barely take care of myself. And I do not have the energy to fight\u2026 This is painful to hear. But there are millions of people like John facing an unimaginable burden due to the cost of medical care. This is why we fight for Medicare for All.\n\nContent warning: suicide https://t.co/gtCtNykvqO Canceling all student debt will not only help those with student loans. It will help all of us \u2014 by boosting our economy by $1 trillion over the next 10 years and creating up to 1.5 million new jobs every year. Jeff Bezos is worth over $110 billion. Amazon pays $0 in federal income taxes. Yet Bezos just cut health care for 2,000 part-time Whole Food workers.\n\nThat is what unfettered greed looks like.\n\nWe're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and guarantee health care to all. One of the reasons I fight for Medicare for All is because I believe we all share a common humanity.\n\nIf your family is in pain, so is mine. If your kids are hurting, that affects me as well.\n\nWe are a better nation than one that simply leaves the poor, sick and unlucky to die. We're going to #cancelstudentdebt and make all public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free.

Tonight is the third Democratic debate and there are hundreds of Bernie 2020 watch parties happening across the country. Find one year you: https://t.co/0gzurtl5gF This is Trump's \"booming\" economy for working families:\n\n-Majority of workers live paycheck to paycheck\n-Nearly half of older Americans have nothing saved for retirement\n-20% of Americans can't afford to see a doctor\n\nBut the billionaire class continues to get richer. Why do we have people working 40 hours a week and can\u2019t afford to feed their kids? The answer is pretty simple: wages in America are too damn low. Fracking is a danger to our water supply and the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. It\u2019s highly explosive. To avert the climate crisis, we must ban fracking. We explain why on the new #HearTheBern: https://t.co/IT4uq2Md7w. https://t.co/s3Tp7R5M58 Before the debate tomorrow night, find a Bernie 2020 watch party near you! Go to https://t.co/0gzurtl5gF to find one and meet with others who are part of our movement to defeat Trump and transform the country. The only way Donald Trump will be defeated is if young people are given a reason to turn out to vote in record numbers. I have zero doubt that is what we are going to do. Uber\u2019s drivers are employees, not independent contractors. Large corporations will do anything to get out of paying workers a decent wage and offering them good benefits. That will end when we are in the White House. https://t.co/ru50Mgga0i Rounding up our homeless neighbors is not a solution.\n\nThe crisis of homelessness has only gotten worse under the Trump administration. When we are in the White House we will make decent, safe, and affordable housing a right for all. https://t.co/HEGvF931EW 55% of @Walmart\u2019s associates struggle with hunger.\n\nMassive corporations like Walmart shouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay workers wages so low that their employees struggle to survive.\n\nWe are going to raise wages and end their corporate greed. Unlike Donald Trump, I know what it's like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck. We must envision a new form of American engagement: one in which we lead not in war-making but in finding shared solutions to shared global challenges. U.S. power should be measured not by our ability to blow things up, but to bring people together around our common humanity. This endless war has damaged America's global standing. It has scarred a generation. It has corroded our politics. It has cost American taxpayers nearly $6 trillion. And it has produced more terrorists. We must end this endless war. Instead of staying focused on those who attacked us, the Bush administration chose to declare a global \u201cwar on terror\u201d in order justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. The war on terror has turned into an endless war. In the nearly two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States has made a series of costly blunders that have not only weakened our democracy but also undermined our leadership. Today, we remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of first responders who put their lives at risk to save others.\n\nThe attacks began an era of endless war for our country and we must change course. https://t.co/UcKuln00lg Netanyahu's proposal to annex occupied territory would violate international law and make a two state solution nearly impossible.
