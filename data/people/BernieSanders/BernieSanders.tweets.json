When politicians like Trump say we must cut food stamps, Medicaid and public housing, it's not because we don't have the money.\n\nWe're the richest country on Earth!\n\nIt's because they refuse to stand up to their billionaire donors, who hoard wealth and stash it in tax havens. No person needs to have tens of billions of dollars while others sleep out on the streets. We're going to tax the ultra rich and use the revenue to guarantee decent housing for all. Mental health care shouldn't be a privilege for the wealthy. It should be accessible to all. Medicare for All will guarantee mental health coverage to every person in this country, free at the point of service. #WorldMentalHealthDay It's not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made $1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.\n\nOur system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.\n\nWe need Medicare for All.

Not only are we going to defeat Trump, we're going to make him pay an additional $142 million with our tax on extreme wealth. When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.

As a federal judge who overwhelmingly sided with corporate power and Wall Street, Brett Kavanaugh should never have been nominated.

We must envision a new form of American engagement: one in which we lead not in war-making but in finding shared solutions to shared global challenges. U.S. power should be measured not by our ability to blow things up, but to bring people together around our common humanity. This endless war has damaged America's global standing. It has scarred a generation. It has corroded our politics. It has cost American taxpayers nearly $6 trillion. And it has produced more terrorists. We must end this endless war. Instead of staying focused on those who attacked us, the Bush administration chose to declare a global \u201cwar on terror\u201d in order justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. The war on terror has turned into an endless war. In the nearly two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States has made a series of costly blunders that have not only weakened our democracy but also undermined our leadership. Today, we remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of first responders who put their lives at risk to save others.\n\nThe attacks began an era of endless war for our country and we must change course. https://t.co/UcKuln00lg Netanyahu's proposal to annex occupied territory would violate international law and make a two state solution nearly impossible.
