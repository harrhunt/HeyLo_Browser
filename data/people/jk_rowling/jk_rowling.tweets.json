Can you understand why many people would see that as victim blaming? @edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G Actually, I\u2019ve just checked and it was even worse.

Copying her in, and withouta word of solidarity, you started talking about Israel. @edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G You responded to a young British Jewish woman tweeting about her personal experiences of antisemitism by demanding that she explain why Israeli flags were at a right wing rally.

There are ways of volunteering that help children, but pouring time and money into orphanages definitely isn\u2019t one of them. 2/2 @frankly_no @AlanGrear @lumos Volunteers often have very good intentions but don\u2019t understand that what they\u2019re doing is harmful. There\u2019s a reason countries in the developed world don\u2019t put their own children in orphanages: they know they have very bad outcomes. Instead they prioritise community-based 1/2 @JonCarre @AlanGrear @lumos Yes, existing studies suggest life outcomes are similarly poor for all institutionalised children. @digitalgoonie @lumos supporting communities so that children can be raised within their own families.

There are even orphanages set up as businesses to attract foreign donations and offer volunteer experiences. There are better ways to donate and volunteer, 2/3 @digitalgoonie @lumos Teaching children to accept physical affection from total strangers is psychologically damaging at best. At worst, it renders them vulnerable to abuse. Children need their families and systems that encourage families to split, whether by offering food, medical care 1/3 @AlanGrear @lumos 80% of the world\u2019s institutionalised children have at least 1 living parent who wants them. There are ways to volunteer which help keep families together, rather than driving a model of \u2018care\u2019 that causes terrible harm, often for profit. See @lumos website for more info 3/3 @AlanGrear @lumos We have 80 years of research proving that children raised in orphanages are likely to suffer developmental delays, stunting and psychological trauma. 1/5 will have a criminal record, 1/7 will be involved in the sex trade and 1/10 will kill themselves. 2/3 @AlanGrear @lumos The point being made is, in fact, about empathy. Volunteers, although often with the best intentions, cause harm by offering affection for limited periods and then vanishing.

The evidence on child institutions has been clearcut for decades: they cause long term trauma, render children vulnerable to abuse and too often lead to disappearances. #ReuniteFamiliesNow Across the developing world, children with living parents are persuaded to institutionalise them, often with the promise of food, medical care or education, which frequently fails to materialise. Yet across the West, we banned \u2018orphanages\u2019 long ago, knowing the harm they cause. Institutionalisation was especially prevalent in Eastern Europe, where children were taken from their families to be \u2018raised\u2019 in state-run institutions. The statistics on these children\u2019s subsequent life outcomes are appalling.

People defending orphanages in the global south should ask them why the UK scrapped\u2026 FYI, I say 'orphanages' in previous tweets because we know that 80% of children in institutions worldwide have at least one living parent. The overwhelming majority are loved and wanted, but driven into institutions because of poverty, discrimination, disability or disaster. I'm afraid all 'orphanages' do harm to children. Murals on the walls, pretty duvet covers, donated teddies and pleasant staff cannot meet a child's core needs. Institutionalisation is proven, no matter how well-intentioned, to do harm.

We need to put funds into inclusive education, health and welfare, children can access from home. We need to develop foster care, support families and stop funding and volunteering at orphanages. /9 1 in 5 institutionalised children will end up with a criminal record. 1 in 7 will enter the sex trade and 1 in 10 will kill themselves. Institutionalising children is an inhumane practice and ought to be outlawed internationally. /8 We know that institutions are too often  created to attract foreign aid and volunteers. There are documented instances of children being kept hungry and abused between volunteer visits. Orphanages can prove a lucrative business model. /7 - sometimes in truly horrific ways. We know (from wealth of research, also easily accessed through @Lumos and other NGOs working in this area) that institutionalisation is closely linked to trafficking. /6 Parents are told that their children will only receive education, medical care, or even food, if they are put into the institution. When money is poured into \u2018orphanages\u2019 rather than community-based health, welfare and schools, children suffer - /5 Research shows (much of which is easily accessed on the @Lumos website) that the primary reasons children enter institutions are poverty, disability, discrimination and emergencies such as war or natural disasters. /4 Foster care has far better outcomes for children who can\u2019t live with their families, or have no family. It is a common misconception in the developed world that children in foreign orphanages are there because the family was unfit to care for them. 3/ We have 80 years of solid research that prove children in institutions (even well-run orphanages, set up with good  intentions) cause children psychological and physical harm /2 The alternative to an abusive family should never be institutionalisation, for many good reasons /1 https://t.co/X7HzqqRptn RT @lumos: \u201cDo you want happy children and young people?
