Also good on you creeping this hard @issa @parpyfn @TTfue When you bring up something irrelevant to the argument you take an L brother. Have a good one man ^_^ @issa @parpyfn @TTfue Two of those are jokes, and the other constructive criticism.  Not blatant negativity.

Everyone has a ball, shadows, or is flying around with the new rotation so shots are impossible. And if you try to take over someone's wall or rush with it... you either have a Tommy or a shotgun that doesn't one hit. Honestly.... I just played some of the worst Fortnite of my life. Felt completely out of my element and w/o the pump I froze in about 5 fights late game when my combat shotgun would not shoot out of shadow mode.

Same for every pro player that uses it. The revert back to season 1 settings, adding arena increasing que times in the later sections, and now... Removing stretch res from Competitions. \n\nAll of this somehow better be paying off because if this is somehow not benefiting epic idk what they are doing.
