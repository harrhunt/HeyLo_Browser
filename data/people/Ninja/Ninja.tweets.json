They are turning into arena matches without siphon and like you said the flow of the games are awkward. It\u2019s probably incredible for the casuals. RT @TheDailyShow: Here\u2019s the full interview with @ninja: https://t.co/e6khnYspM3 @LachlanYT @TTfue I played it during SBMM... idk where your getting your info dude lol I personally do not like the que times and mega tryhards due to skill based matchmaking. I\u2019ve addressed my concerns in a constructive way and have been trying to use my influence behind the scenes to figure out the best solution, even if that\u2019s reverting. https://t.co/go3Y66mlOE @Asmongold @TTfue Again, I\u2019ll say it a thousand times! There are positive ways and constructive ways to address things you don\u2019t like about games. @LachlanYT @TTfue Been doing it for the last week. @FortniteBRLive I was 5 years younger and less experienced in competition and so much more. I\u2019m trying to use what I\u2019ve learned over 8 years of streaming and 10 years of professional gaming to stop shit I\u2019ve seen and done in the past. Learn from your mistakes! Also good on you creeping this hard @issa @parpyfn @TTfue When you bring up something irrelevant to the argument you take an L brother. Have a good one man ^_^ @issa @parpyfn @TTfue Two of those are jokes, and the other constructive criticism.  Not blatant negativity. Issa cmon man lol your stretching and it\u2019s embarrassing @infamous_FN @TTfue Someone forcing you to play? @parpyfn @TTfue Coming from the dude tweeting about how shit the game is yet plays it and uploads Fortnite videos everyday? What\u2019s more of an #ad? Shitty insult @TTfue I actually have been enjoying the game recently after the Gotham City update. If you don\u2019t enjoy the game, stop playing and roasting it all the time.

Everyone has a ball, shadows, or is flying around with the new rotation so shots are impossible. And if you try to take over someone's wall or rush with it... you either have a Tommy or a shotgun that doesn't one hit. Honestly.... I just played some of the worst Fortnite of my life. Felt completely out of my element and w/o the pump I froze in about 5 fights late game when my combat shotgun would not shoot out of shadow mode. Did not qualify for Sunday :( @alex_reno @AyeyoKEJO Spicy chicken deluxe combo with chic fil a sauce @WittLowry &lt;3 Solo qualifiers today...

Constructive criticism is good and delivering your message correctly to your audience should be most important. @Avxry Do you think people on twitter are reading u call things garbage and thinking \"I bet hes just kidding\" @Avxry \"Enjoying the garbage\" Maybe if you are having fun with the game don't call things Garbage.
