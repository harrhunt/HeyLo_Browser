That\u2019s how our online-society works nowadays. Anything for RTs lol @Zichivhu @Trends_SADC Every tweet I make is sponsored automatically. It\u2019s a new feature in beta only some people have access to. :) @littlefangz Ugh I wish.... unfortunately I have to pay for my Teslas.... maybe one day \ud83d\ude1d @romainwilbert I wasn\u2019t tired. :) \nI was wide awake. Just like millions of drivers. And out of nowhere got super tired so fast I didn\u2019t even realize how tired I was, just like millions of drivers. I wish humans had good enough judgment - but most of us don\u2019t. So it makes it safer. @DMJreports That\u2019s totally fair. I\u2019m just saying that while reporting about the crashes, it\u2019s only fair to also report the far superior rate of accidents that were prevented thanks to auto pilot (like my example). Important to stay neutral I think. @DMJreports Was going to ASAP since other people were in the car already anyway and next thing thing I remember is it beeped and I realized - holy shit - i must have not touched the steering wheel for minutes. Sometimes u don\u2019t realize how tired u are until it\u2019s too late. @DMJreports You\u2019re wrong. I got in the car absolutely not tired. And on the way I got tired out of no where after an exhausting day. And the auto pilot was the reason why I got back safe. You can deny it all you want - there\u2019s opinions, and there\u2019s facts. Thank you for that! https://t.co/z1pful3ov6 Had a great time in the DR with great people!! \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/zCN7OKsovB @Ghastly Exactly! It\u2019s so ridiculous. Had to tell my side of the story - I find it much more interesting to read about how many lives self diving cars can safe instead. @rduran Because I didn\u2019t touch the steering wheel for a couple minutes and then it turned off the music and started beeping. @charli_xcx That\u2019s a fucking dope pic There\u2019s lots of \u201cbad\u201d news about Teslas w/ autopilot crashing. \nJust to show the other side too:\nI once fell asleep driving home late at night on the highway (w/ autopilot on) and got woken up by it beeping + turning off music to wake me up. Would have prob been dead without it. THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC w/ @TheChainsmokers https://t.co/l43zbAv16V @realDonaldTrump Let\u2019s do Fuckjerry and 9gag next!!

I\u2019ve never used it but I\u2019m sure it has a similar function where you set the key. \nFor this purpose I\u2019ve used auto tune since day one so I\u2019m more comfortable with that \ud83d\ude48 @Ookay Dawgy, set auto tune to \u201cminor\u201d instead of \u201cchromatic\u201d.

But still, wouldn\u2019t hurt to have the function. Also, @Apple, an idea of the future would be the ability to block a number directly from the call screen. \nWe all know nowadays everyone is being bombarded with spam / robo calls. maybe force touching the red button (decline) can give you the option to block a number from there? just went back to a macbook without touch bar and it feels SO GOOD to have all those physical keys back ... i missed my escape key. and mute.... and volume ... and just all of them ... and they are always in the same spot and never randomly change functions.... i am happy I\u2019m thrilled to be performing \u201cThe Middle\u201d live on the @BBMAs with @MarenMorris and @greymusic.
