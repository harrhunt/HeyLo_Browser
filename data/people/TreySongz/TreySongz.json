He has thousands of death threats already. @DallasPD meanwhile people are still tweeting this mans name and picture as if he is a killer. Clarification on your part is necessary. @YoureAllNutz @DallasPD the point is people want to kill this man. When you point the finger and say \"cop killer\" u must retract! @DallasPD NO retraction, no admittance of wrong doing. Just endanger this mans life and because a tweet is deleted it's ok. So @DallasPD put this man's life in danger, posted his face for all to see as a cop killer. And when he's cleared, they just delete it.
