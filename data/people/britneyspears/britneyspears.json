It\u2019s been the journey of a lifetime, but I\u2019m grateful for every moment. Getting to know you all over the years has been such an incredible experience. Thank you for all your support \u2764\ufe0f #BabyOneMoreTime20 https://t.co/vbj10cDn2C I appreciate your prayers and support for my family during this time. Thank you, and love you all\u2026 always. I had to make the difficult decision to put my full focus and energy on my family at this time. I hope you all can understand. More information on ticket refunds is available on https://t.co/SBF4WxXT31. However, it\u2019s important to always put your family first\u2026 and that\u2019s the decision I had to make. A couple of months ago, my father was hospitalized and almost died. We\u2019re all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him. I don\u2019t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say. I will not be performing my new show Domination. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this show and seeing all of you this year, so doing this breaks my heart. https://t.co/kHgFAVTjNA @thebrooklyncat Can\u2019t wait to see you in Vegas!!!!
