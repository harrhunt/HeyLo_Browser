Don\u2019t get your panties in a bunch @waldorfsfinest What\u2019s the problem? @bansky Great point @russbengtson Lol glad we agree @russbengtson I thought it was a legit question @russbengtson Why\u2019d u say this buddy? @ChefJay1987 Take that up with the people that wanna know this info \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @benashun @Mitt and I rather be me than u @benashun @Mitt I\u2019m not an adult @CuffsTheLegend \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 @CuffsTheLegend My bad my bad, I will delete.

U know every area has had some God level hoopers. @Plan__J @HPbasketball @CornerHoops @DreamShakeSBN Yea exactly, once it gets deeper then I\u2019m off of It. @Plan__J @HPbasketball @CornerHoops @DreamShakeSBN Whoa that\u2019s drastic, see this is when I like looking at numbers, it felt like he never shot them while I watched him. @Plan__J @CornerHoops @DreamShakeSBN @HPbasketball He\u2019s never been the one to shoot middies. He like the quick step back in the mid but that\u2019s about it. Always to the cup or the 3. It\u2019s been that way @CornerHoops @DreamShakeSBN @HPbasketball James always played off the dribble like that, what have u been watching?He been that same player since artesia. He added a lil more wiggle and some experience but analytics ain\u2019t the reason u seeing this @TommyValtin @marshallous @HPbasketball I just think the game is simple. We complicate it with all the numbers. Some are good but some are just confusing. @TommyValtin @marshallous @HPbasketball I used analytics during the summer one time to see what my percentages were from each spot on the floor, I knew my overall percentages were solid but I wanted a deeper breakdown. Then I worked on where I was lacking. That\u2019s it. @DreamShakeSBN @HPbasketball I think every 1st and 2nd option in the nba should ignore analytics n just hoop off feel. Most of them do. @marshallous @TommyValtin Nah bruh, he started learning that shit after we started working out. I didn\u2019t tell him to do it, that\u2019s a basketball savant being proactive and finding other ways to help his clients get better. @BenKercheval @HPbasketball Usually how shit goes smh @bansky This ain\u2019t it scrap https://t.co/u0FSI9VncA @hb__rayLamier @HPbasketball @DreamShakeSBN Thank you. @HPbasketball @DreamShakeSBN I just wanna start every game trying to make my first 3 shots. Wherever they may be @HPbasketball @DreamShakeSBN I usually play off of feel though, if I\u2019m hot from the 3 then I\u2019m taking a lot of 3s, if my middy workin then that\u2019s where I\u2019m goin for dinner. If the lane open then I\u2019m staying in the paint. @DreamShakeSBN @HPbasketball Who else do u think can ignore analytics? @HPbasketball I don\u2019t view the game as math. That\u2019s the only difference in the convo. I get what you\u2019re saying but we just have 2 different views of the game. Analytics is a good way to simplify things tho. @HPbasketball I see dudes taking a bunch of 3s and still aren\u2019t good at them. U just gotta look in the mirror lol @HPbasketball @SplashMyers I just spoke about taking them, u don\u2019t know how good u can be at them if u just ignore it all together. @SplashMyers @HPbasketball Who the fuck wants to look at graphs while having a hoop convo? @HPbasketball https://t.co/sgAOKubVTO @HPbasketball U gotta be confident to make any shot, but whatever u work on the most is what you\u2019ll be best at @RobertjBoyd2 @HPbasketball That\u2019s how I was taught @HPbasketball Them game is going towards 3s and lays only so why would anyone work on that shot? If it wasn\u2019t forbidden then players would work on it and they would develop that shot. @YoGabbaGabrus @HPbasketball Exactly @rkattijr @HPbasketball So hunt for 3s? I think it\u2019s balance that u have. @HPbasketball It\u2019s not about me, I see dudes passing up open shots in the mid range, like wide open, to force passes to the 3 point line or force up bad finishes at the rim. @22Milto @Rachel__Nichols I\u2019m good because I work on them nonstop. So if u walk into a gym and focus on making mid range shots, u can be good too @HPbasketball Sometimes it\u2019s just the open shot. Why pass up an wide open look to shoot a semi contested shot? @Rachel__Nichols Shoot em Zach @brkicks @raf_tyler \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc0d @overtime Dropped him off but was that not 3 seconds? @brkicks @MELOD1P Those the Melo\u2019s now Travis Scott is just different.

Lol he took it.. that year I wasn\u2019t even thirsty for it. @waldorfsfinest Let? He took it lol RT @BaronDavis: Shout out to all the hoopers that\u2019s not in the NBA.

We can both occupy this wonderful city! It\u2019s all love on this side @ASAPbuzzy @theScore Aye man, what I say isn\u2019t the holy grail. The human brain can ignore anything that they don\u2019t believe in @rendito_sea @irenealcachupas The ladies and gents don\u2019t care about this convo champ but you are in your feelings over what I said. It\u2019s cool, every human is emotional @rendito_sea @irenealcachupas You\u2019re being real emotional right now. @rendito_sea @irenealcachupas The fans, the players and ownership matter just the same in all of this. Get out ya feelings because I did a lil interview @rendito_sea @irenealcachupas Yes the owner of the team pays my salary, never got a dime from u @irenealcachupas @rendito_sea Not yours though @rendito_sea Bruh asked me a question lol it ain\u2019t that serious, it\u2019s only basketball. @YoungLaurent93 I do it every game. I wasn\u2019t even thinking lol @waldorfsfinest I don\u2019t control none of that @waldorfsfinest U didn\u2019t give the situation. I def want the rock but if coach calls a play for someone else then it\u2019s cool too @waldorfsfinest I\u2019m still cool with it @waldorfsfinest Yea u wanted me to be perfect lol @ScoutWithBryan Dope @overtime @tackofall99 @NBCSBoston Why would that boy try to finesse the lay against him \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @CHECKTHESTRIPES Of course.

I\u2019m praising both @__jay__g @LoadingSzn @OprahSide U tell me first @sarmadhansari @Elliott_Duncan @TOUK8 @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @OprahSide The no look pass? I love everything about mahomes but that, I know Andy Reid and the OC be low key hot about that lol @travion23 @OprahSide Ain\u2019t nobody trading or benching Rodgers. Chill @LoadingSzn @OprahSide No doubt, it\u2019s his league I\u2019m not saying that but Arod still nice. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, got damn \ud83d\ude44 @Elliott_Duncan @TOUK8 @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @OprahSide How can his talent still be there but it\u2019s not the same? That makes no sense. @Witness4Life6 @TOUK8 @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide How can I hate a 2nd year quarterback when I\u2019m comparing him to arguably the best QB of my generation. Smh think @Elliott_Duncan @TOUK8 @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @OprahSide Arod\u2019s talent hasn\u2019t gone anywhere that\u2019s why I say this @TOUK8 @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide Nah I watch the games, then the highlights afterwards and then I\u2019m following the stats. I\u2019m locked in. Are u? @sizzz81 @TwoFaceTheGreat @cantaluope @TOUK8 @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide I agree @AJ_ThompsonJr If we win today. We clearly are the champs. We should sign colt to a 5 year deal @TOUK8 @cantaluope @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide Google it. @BankrollTyler @martellohicks @OprahSide A new head coach? That\u2019s cool and that coach is probably dope but learning a whole new scheme from your last coach is pretty difficult but Arod can gracefully do it. Yes I\u2019m a Stan @DWodders @X23937807 @ant243estrada @FakMeUp12 @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide \u201cJust like Rodgers\u201d no doubt mahomes is amazing and it\u2019s his league for a while but arod still a dog \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @cantaluope @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide Ok, imagine if arod had the chiefs weapons @ant243estrada @X23937807 @FakMeUp12 @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide Lol just seen that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but there\u2019s a lot of people of believe mahomes over arod anyway @thejohnlooper @NotionsOfJacob @OprahSide Now you\u2019re gonna bypass what u see on the field every week to believe something you have no real info on. If u wanna do that, it\u2019s cool. Enjoy @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide It\u2019s fair but u can\u2019t just casually put mahomes over arod. We gonna have to stop and talk about that decision lol @Elliott_Duncan @OprahSide Idk man Aaron Rodgers can make every throw and he still instills fear into defenses. @K_Mo_27 @OprahSide I\u2019m no guru but mahomes has been in the league for a year and a half. Arod been elite for like 10 years and still goin lol. Idk it just sounds crazy to me but mahomes on some other shit too @OprahSide So now pat mahomes is considered a better football player than Rodgers? @CuffsTheLegend Hate to see it @waldorfsfinest U not a astronaut like that to know who\u2019s gonna win. Cut the shit @waldorfsfinest I forgot that u could bet on games now. @waldorfsfinest You wild lmao I forgot @waldorfsfinest What money? It\u2019s preseason lol @Aj_Kimp I salute u my good man @KedowWalker Been a bucket his whole life @American7832 @ScoutWithBryan @TheNBAAnalyst1 Me @JumpmanJordan It was tough? \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/ybO9YfozCr @safirahman_ @shinideath22 It\u2019s what buys the suits and backwoods. It\u2019s all jokes, Shannon and skip need to be on tv. They tie all this together in a weird way @shinideath22 It\u2019s not about what the reporters want. The fans need to hear that raw shit imo @bussa_nut @ScoutWithBryan Who\u2019s fault is that? @bansky @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Shit was poetic. He painted that picture like biggie lol @Krisplashed @russbengtson @CountOnVic @bansky @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Then obviously we aren\u2019t talking about you. @bansky @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan I think a lot of people are fascinated with what their favorite athletes are thinking while they do this amazing shit. I wonder too. @IMG_98 @ScoutWithBryan @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee I feel sorry for them. @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan @SLAMonline Great point. I def depends on publication. Of course the newspapers have bigger things to cover than basketball lol @ScoutWithBryan @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee Used to be back from 2011-2015. It\u2019s a different game now @russbengtson @roddy_pee @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @ScoutWithBryan That\u2019s called dumbing yourself down @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Don\u2019t u set the pace? If they can\u2019t keep up then that\u2019s on them lol but I get u may not make money like this. Then it gets a little deeper than basketball, I feel that too @_RollinStoner @russbengtson @brooklynnets85 @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Good point @russbengtson @CarlisleKR @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Yea but for example,  if u ask a player about the name of a set and why coached called the play, u might get a more detailed answer. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gettin at @russbengtson @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan That\u2019s cool too. I\u2019m saying fans want to know more nowadays so the reporters have to get more educated on the game to switch the questions up. It\u2019s getting repetitive @jerryseinfeldjr Stay woke lol @ScoutWithBryan @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee Im all about taking the best look. Sometimes it may be a middy @brooklynnets85 @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Truth of the matter, reporters have to ask better questions about the game. They have to get educated. They are educated on how to get clicks. @_RollinStoner @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan I think they owe it to the fans. Well they don\u2019t owe it to them but I would think fans would enjoy it more @roddy_pee @ScoutWithBryan Wild to me too but nowadays u don\u2019t have to have that much knowledge to get the job. Gotta look the part and know someone lol @ScoutWithBryan @TheNBAAnalyst1 The thing about it is, nobody cares lol majority watch for the entertainment component only @ScoutWithBryan @TheNBAAnalyst1 I think you\u2019re in minority of people who wanna hear athletes talk like this. We\u2019re programmed to have surface level conversations @ScoutWithBryan I learned a lot from watching this. @Ernesto34637721 You have a favorite sibling? U vibe with each person different. Its all love @DaveGraham25 @isoballpod @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky That\u2019s a great point. Looking only at the numbers can overrate a player and fuck up the market lol. Either way, it\u2019s all good for the sport @Anthonysmdoyle @isoballpod @DaRealBootum @bansky Follow the ball and you\u2019ll be good. @LeeTheKYFan @isoballpod @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky Top 5 @isoballpod @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky Nah I never looked at stats and said a guy is better than I thought. I just say he had a great night. I look at the game and say to myself, some guys are way better than what the stats show @isoballpod @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky Nah I agree with that 1000% but I\u2019m talking about using the eye test when you\u2019re evaluating players. Analytics definitely helps with a game plan and scouting and also evaluating the direction the team is going. I get that @BenchWarmerPost @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky I was out with a injury in the 2015 playoffs bucko. That was the warriors vs the rockets @Anthonysmdoyle @DaRealBootum @bansky It may be hard for u since u just started watching a few years back but it\u2019s pretty easy to see what\u2019s goin on out there lol @bansky Preach @waldorfsfinest He got bars for sure.

U get more buckets than the other team and u win @waldorfsfinest I don't get what u tryna say. @waldorfsfinest u like assist and rebounds right? U make a pass so that u can score right? U rebound an attempted shot right? @waldorfsfinest elaborate @blazeisbaseball he wore number 1 on his jersey The game will always be about buckets. When it comes to buckets, there was nobody like T-Mac. FOH, number 1 in the HOF. Respect OG \ud83d\udde3HA RT @laurenepowell: A terrible day.

Stop looking at stats, u will learn a lot watching @ParkerHanft just arguing over basketball. Something I'll probably do for the rest of my life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @Abdiqalis yes it does and vice versa but I'm not even the court in this pic lol @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke so as soon as steph walks across he gets double teamed? @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke lol u got it big homie lol @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke ok @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke they do NOT get doubled team. You got watch the games when they are on, not twitter lol @Legend_Today much love bro @HatcherSeth I get it, you're hurt on a personal level, sorry. But we are talking about the actual game. Wrong convo for u lol @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke why would I want to play basketball against 2 people? Why should they have an advantage? @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball. Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one? I need a double team every play? @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke nope that was just bad transition defense. Not strategy @KDTrey5 @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke and its 9.6 seconds left in the half. Most teams trap in pick and roll that late @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke matter fact, I'm not even in the game. Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke issa pick and roll. He only got trapped cuz it was a screen. And do u see me wide open? @SK6Stan nah my narratives don't fit. @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke you're tellin me? Lol @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke I see y'all arguing, just wanted to give some insight into the game! \ud83d\udcaf @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke nobody got double teamed the whole series. Pick and rolls is 2 on 2 defense, not traps @BrandoX_FSU no charge @ThaRealRicci Tell them stop asking me questions all the damn time Shoutout Guwop for the inspiration, I see the growth big dog.
