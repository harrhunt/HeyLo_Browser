He gives you yes &amp; no lists 2 go by &amp; tells why you should avoid things &amp; basically it all comes down to lectins &amp; inflammation.

Other fake news that\u2019s going around about me is that I\u2019ve been taking weird pills 4 weight loss or doing weird fad diets. All of this is not true. I ain\u2019t got time 4 all that. I eat the same stuff I always have. It\u2019s all just made w/different flours/sugars/ingredients. #DrGundry This is fake news &amp; not me. What is wrong with people? I mean, I\u2019m way too busy to be sitting around creating fake accounts. I mean, people if you\u2019re that bored go ahead &amp; do the world a service and maybe read a book &amp; better yourself rather than be weird &amp; lie to people\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/EfqvSnGFHX RT @NBCTheVoice: Retweet to #VoiceSaveRod Retweet, retweet, retweet!!! #VoiceSaveRod!!

The song has no formula. It\u2019s a rant of emotions, thoughts, and dreams all in one fell swoop. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife Why by Annie Lennox has and will always be my favorite song to listen to.

I never want anyone to feel left out and I always want to make everyone feel special. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife I think we all give love how we want to receive it. For example, I have abandonment issues so for me showing love is simply showing up, being there, and validating a persons existence, emotions, and moments.  #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife RT @MomItForward: Q4: @KELLY_CLARKSON\u2019S SINGLE \u201cLOVE SO SOFT\u201d https://t.co/sYGwICSoM8 SAYS: \u201cIF YOU WANT THIS LOVE, GOT TO HOLD IT TIGHT.\u201d\u2026 Music is one of the most connecting things in this world. Melodies become nostalgic, and chords become emotions. It\u2019s beautiful! #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife Aretha, Whitney, and Mariah made me want to be singer with not only their catalogues of amazing songs, but the way they are so different yet so effective in the soulful/pop sound that it transcends genres and just makes you feel alive and inspired. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife Rosemary Clooney and Ella Fitzgerald inspired me to love big band, jazz, and a level of musicianship that is incredible. Steven Tyler, Alanis Morissette, and The Toadies taught me how to let go of perfection and really truly emote. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife I have always been passionate about music in a variety of genres.\n#gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife RT @MomItForward: Q3: @KELLY_CLARKSON\u2019S \u201cMEANING OF LIFE\u201d ALBUM FEATURES A VARIETY OF MUSIC GENRES FROM R&amp;B &amp; SOUL TO POP &amp; MORE.

No one can do everything. No one should have to do everything. So always remember to ask for or accept help. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife Both of these things can consume me at times. Whenever I meet a new mom and they ask me for advice I always say let go of trying to control everything and stop feeling guilty for wanting/needing moments for yourself. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife There are 2 things I am constantly working on as a mother.
