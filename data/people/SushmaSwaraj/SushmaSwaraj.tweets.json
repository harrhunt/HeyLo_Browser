I am very sad to know that Shri Jaipal Reddy Ji is no more. We were together in Parliament for many years. He was very assertive in the House and very warm at personal level. I will miss a dear friend #JaipalReddy. Azam Khan is known for making such statements which prove that he suffers from mental perversion. The statement that he made while addressing a lady Chairperson crossed all limits of decency. He deserves a stringent punishment to preserve the dignity and decorum of the House. \u0906\u091c\u093c\u092e \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u090f \u0917\u090f \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u092f\u0939 \u0938\u093e\u092c\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0935\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093f\u0915 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0902. \u0915\u0932 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0938\u092d\u093e\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0915\u094b \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0909\u0928\u0915\u093e \u092c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u092c\u0926\u0938\u0932\u0942\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0926\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u093e. \u0938\u0902\u0938\u0926\u0940\u092f \u092e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0924\u0915\u093e\u091c\u093c\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u091c\u093c\u092e \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0938\u091c\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947. #\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0917\u093f\u0932 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0915\u0947 \u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0943\u0924\u091c\u094d\u091e \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f \u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f \u0928\u092e\u0928.

Congratulations to Team India on a splendid victory. The news about my appointment as Governor of Andhra Pradesh is not true. I called on the Vice President of India Shri Venkaiah Naidu ji on demitting office as Minister of External affairs.  This was enough for Twitter to  appoint me as the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. I am extremely sorry to hear about the sad demise of Shri Girish Karnad.
