If a student doesn\u2019t use Missions, but instead only uses the \u201cexplore\u201d section, they can achieve 100% mastery. @MrBodde Re: Q1 cont'd: Getting 100% on all units would get you 80% of the way to mastering the course, and getting 100% on the course challenge gets you the remaining 20%. *BUT* we are now changing this so that the course challenge is optional. @MrBodde Re: Q1 \u201cCan a student still reach 100% mastery by completing just the missions section?\u201d Our new system was designed to require that a student gets 100% on all the units AND 100% on the course challenge (which didn\u2019t exist in missions) to achieve 100% mastery for a course.
