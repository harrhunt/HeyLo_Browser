Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says can\u2019t testify, &amp; the reason he can\u2019t testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud &amp; totally different from the actual transcribed call... https://t.co/Kj1LtwYSXa https://t.co/YgXImlvOYd The @StLouisBlues amazing comeback reminds us to never give up \u2013 and never lose faith.

At the same time, Syria and whoever they chose to help, wants naturally to protect the Kurds.... ....and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away! After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land.

Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War? The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset!

What\u2019s happening now is that the U.S. is finally responding (thank you President Trump). This is taking..... Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE &amp; terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress &amp;  the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud! \u201cChina Trade Turmoil: China Urging a CALM AND RATIONAL Solution.\u201d @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness China is doing very poorly while the USA, under your favorite President\u2019s leadership, continues to soar to new heights - and, despite the Do Nothing Democrats, we have just begun!

We need to get good stuff done. Let the people vote,.... These Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are doing great harm to our Country. They are lying &amp; cheating like never before in our Country\u2019s history in order to destabilize the United States of America &amp; it\u2019s upcoming 2020 Election.

Big Consequences! His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud &amp; Treason..... Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way.

Good idea, except I will, and have always expected to, lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS.. \u201cDemocrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.\u201d Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are, will they \u201cmove the goalposts\u201d and, is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts, but I\u2019ll be able to figure it out! Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u201cairspace\u201d when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see? Just Out: \u201cKavanaugh accuser doesn\u2019t recall incident.\u201d @foxandfriends  DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued! \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. This guy is not a good man, he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!\u201d Dan Bongino @foxandfriends \u201cThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.\u201d @foxandfriends  The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. ...The United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can\u2019t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell &amp; the Fed don\u2019t have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus! Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China\u2019s big devaluation of their currency, coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates... Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, &amp; now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas, &amp; in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! .....\u2019These Conservative Judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come,\u2019 said Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has been speeding through Trump nominees.\u201d The entire Court System is changing at a record pace! The @nytimes. \u201cThis week, the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr. Trump\u2019s Administration to a lifetime appointment, far outstripping Barack Obama\u2019s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr. Trump and Mr. O\u2019Connell to remake the Federal Judiciary.... ....work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the \u201cCongressional Slush Fund,\u201d and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST! House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that \u201cTrump\u201d has done over his lifetime. But it doesn\u2019t.... \u201cWe cannot have what happened to this President happen again.\u201d Joe DiGenova.  \u201cIt is time for Justice to come barreling in.\u201d @LouDobbs  Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World, the Witch Hunt, though on a respirator, is still whimpering along. A disgrace! The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u201cNo Conditions.\u201d That is an incorrect statement (as usual!). Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal! PLENTY OF OIL! Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! ....sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States. Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount.... ....Then, on top of it all, Kathleen Parker, of all people, wrote \u201cIn Case You Were Wondering, Trump Won The Debate.\u201d True, but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? NOT Fake News! Can\u2019t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story, \u201cUnity Issue Has Parties Pointing To Trump. GOP Goes All In, While Democrats Clash Over Ideology &amp; Tactics. Mr. President, We Are With You The Entire Way. REPUBLICANS Have....Coalesced Around Trump.\u201d..... I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News, the Deep State, the Democrats, and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS, who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation), with the help of some truly great Republicans, and others. We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week)! Can\u2019t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!
