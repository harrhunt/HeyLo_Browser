Never ending wars will end! Brian Kilmeade over at @foxandfriends got it all wrong. We are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years. Europe had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u201cLet the USA pay,\u201d they said... Former Democrat Senator Harry Reid just stated that Donald Trump is very smart, much more popular than people think, is underestimated, and will be hard to beat in the 2020 Election. Thank you Harry, I agree! ....Democrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript, and when Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister said there was NO PRESSURE, very normal talk! A total Impeachment Scam! Adam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.. \u201cThe Democrats are trashing this President, &amp; in the process, trashing the U.S. Constitution.

CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS! ....I agreed not to increase Tariffs from 25% to 30% on October 15th. They will remain at 25%. The relationship with China is very good. We will finish out the large Phase One part of the deal, then head directly into Phase Two. The Phase One Deal can be finalized &amp; signed soon! My deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED! Likewise financial services and other deal aspects, start preparing.... The Democrats are going to lose a lot of House Seats because of their Fraudulent use of Impeachment. Schiff fabricated phone call, a crime. Democrat Senate Seats will also be put at risk, even some that were supposedly safe. Look at Louisiana last night, North Carolina last week!

Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned! .....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War? The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset!

Others ended in ashes!

FEMA and all others are ready,  and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan! So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China, from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact, they got taken to the cleaners.

This has never happened to them before! \u201cThe infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office\u201d @OANN  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do!

Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought! @JudicialWatch .....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone! Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to \u201cwill\u201d the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.  Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world... Democrats want Open Borders and Crime! So dangerous for our Country. But we are building a big, beautiful, NEW Wall! I will protect America, the Dems don\u2019t know where to start! https://t.co/D0APaAxvVm ....got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, \u201csomething big\u201d was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn\u2019t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy! Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable \u201cnut job\u201d who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, &amp; then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,... Great cohesion inside the Republican Party, the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News, my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we\u2019ve had so far! Think what they\u2019d be if I got fair media coverage! RT @RealOmarNavarro: I love @realDonaldTrump. He\u2019s the only President in my lifetime who stands for our country. RT @OliverMcGee: Retweet @POTUS isn't RACIST when @Prince wrote @realDonaldTrump Black Version! \ud83d\ude06\n\nDonald Trump: Black Version\nMaybe that's\u2026 RT @OliverMcGee: Retweet The Lies, False Facts &amp; Fake News of @CNN's @Acosta on @POTUS!\n\nRaise Your Hand if you LOVE @realDonaldTrump has S\u2026 RT @OliverMcGee: Wow. Throwback to when Senator Barack Obama agreed with @realDonaldTrump on immigration! RT this so your friends see this!\u2026 RT @TVNewsHQ: WATCH: \u201cMSNBC is rewarding hate-filled conspiracy theorists with air time because their Trump Derangement Syndrome demands it\u2026 RT @MariaBartiromo: Trump rarely uses racial categories. It is the media and Democratic leaders who routinely issue race-based denunciation\u2026 The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office, hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune, even now, especially after their massive unfunded liability. I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019ll endorse me just to keep it all going! Thank you @TedCruz, I couldn\u2019t agree more! https://t.co/MGq0xXin0s House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it &amp; the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party! Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA! Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldn\u2019t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong! We are doing very well with China, and talking! Doing really well! https://t.co/UndcviEiML RT @MariaBartiromo: Lindsey Graham on IG investigation into Russia probe: I want the American people to see what happened https://t.co/gM0y\u2026 RT @MariaBartiromo: .@LindseyGrahamSC Sen.

With all that this Administration has accomplished, think what my Poll Numbers would be if we had an honest Media, which we do not! .....\u201dJournalism\u201d has reached a new low in the history of our Country. It is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party. The reporting is so false, biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...But the public is aware! #CROOKEDJOURNALISM The Failing New York Times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report &amp; his testimony were a total disaster), to a Racism Witch Hunt..... RT @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/JDS4zVfyBe RT @SharylAttkisson: I read that Trump rally was rambling/half-empty. I also read the opposite. I like to watch candidates' rallies myself\u2026 RT @FullMeasureNews: Coming up this Sunday on Full Measure - the media's \"huge credibility problem\" #mediamiss https://t.co/3f1YiFarg6 RT @SharylAttkisson: From what I can tell, he was not there, it was a campaign event and protest. https://t.co/MGlIIAEFBT Such a disgrace at the once great @nytimes! https://t.co/UKjP6AU0hz RT @twytter14: @tashlutsa @realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ Winning!!!!
