Dear Paul, aap purush nahi... Octopus ho. Paul beat me but it, was not a fair contest, he got 8 hands! @Abhi1Jeet ha ha ha. So Paul proved more powerful than me. Congratulations Spain! Well done. A well deserved win. @kartikk1985 Spain. But I am so sleepy. I can hardly keep my eyes open. Ok. I back Spain. Ths tme I'm the same side as Paul. Lets c if hs ability 2 predict correctly is strongly, or my ability 2 predict wrong! @juniorbachchan so well done Abhishek. Congratulations. @chaitubeck am in no mood to watch the match after Paa. Had been wanting to watch Paa since before its release. So glad I watched it today. Vidhya has given one more outstanding performance. Really loved Abhishek. He hit just the right note, very moving. Just got back home after watching Paa. Had a good cry. Lovely film. Amithji is outstanding. Learning experience watching him. Looking forward to an exciting evening! @jaipunjani phir worldcup ki maut. Dono mein se ek ki maut mere hato likhi hai! At least it indicates that my record, like that of Paul the octopus, is 100%!!!

Was stuck on a Delhi-Bombay flight which kept getting delayed. so was sitting on the plane for over 4 hrs!!! Hey! For last couple of days couldn't access twitter for some reason.
