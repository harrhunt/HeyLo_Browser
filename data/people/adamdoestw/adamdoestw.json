Well anyway, I figured out that almost 50% of people are depressed and 40% have considered suicide (this is at weber) and a few have attempted and 3 have been successful this semester. Each death affects 150 people and 30 (minimum) permanently.

Hey @annarpeacock, Thank you for the follow! So a little awesome testimony thing: I was feeling really anxious about life and problems and stuff I gotta do and I prayed and I feel good. #midnighttestimony I figured out that I'm also anxious about other people that have done more than me - if I know them personally - (which sounds selfish and kind of is).\n\nI am also anxious about the future and anxious that I don't know what I want exactly to do and be.\n\nWell, that's all for today. ... gotten better over the years but it still sucks sometimes.\n\nI'm afraid of failure which kinda sucks if you are in the entertainment industry.\n\nAnd finally (for now) I'm anxious about my anxieties but sharing them feels good! I thought of more anxieties to share on this #WorldMentalHealthDay.\n\nI'm anxious about not doing enough and not getting recognition. It all stems from seeing people who've \"made it\" and how their lives are.\n\nI'm anxious about being sick and not feeling well. This anxiety has... ... about what I've said in group chats or with people. I'm worried what they'll think and I'm 18 years old and passed high school where that should matter. I used to have a persona of not caring but now I do. It's something that I have to sometimes just forget. That's it for now ... not taking this opportunity that I was given (wedding reception I forgot to go to, tickets I was given to something) and I have to keep thinking why I didn't go. Sometimes, of course, I have rehearsal but sometimes I kinda wish I'd still gone.\n\nI also get anxious thinking... For #WorldMentalHealthDay I'm going to share some of my random anxieties:\nI get anxious when I think of things that I had wish I had done and I can't stop thinking of it over and over again and have to find excuses for why I didn't. Examples are: not auditioning for this show... Here are some resources:\n\nSuicide Prevention Hotline: https://t.co/KJ8vBfGIR5\nhttps://t.co/hOYHky0oZ9: https://t.co/m8aP55onA7 Hey, remember on this #WorldMentalHealthDay that you are amazing and you can get through this if it is something that is for now and if it is for your life you can live a wonderful life and find help.

So my human development textbook called out adoption agencies that don't allow gay couples to adopt and so I say officially: WE STAN KATHLEEN BERGER!!! And the author of the textbook agrees. But Sigmund Freud is canceled. Nevermind I'm really dumb and didn't realize it was just a theory. I think my human development book just canceled itself? @calvinjburke What talk was this? Human Development makes me wish I was rich so I could take care of all the unfortunate kids in the world! So idk how the rest of Queer Mormon Twitter feels about it, but I really am enjoying Elder Soares talk. When he mentioned same-sex attraction and wasn't super heavy about \"getting over it\" or \"not giving in\" etc. but was like, \"it sucks I know, but you're awesome\" I liked it. To continue: Ask your straight friends if it something that is worth considering. Then skim through it and find the good bits, or ask them to tell you.\n\nAlso remember the difference between homophobic and hurtful things and \u201ccalling out\u201d or telling us change is important My Queer Conference Survival Guide:\nIf someone mentions something homophobic, transphobic, or something that would effect your emotional health than just mute the video/TV and wait they\u2019re done. I haven\u2019t done it yet but I feel good about it.

You'll do great if you are prepared!!!! @Kyrsten_Marie96 They can usually tell your skill right when you start, but they usually want to see some character. Move around a little and make sure your movements are thought and not little nervous ticks. They usually are very relaxed with that, especially community theatre. @Kyrsten_Marie96 Tell them how fast you want the music (usually under your breath kinda sing it) and where things start and end (always clearly mark it too) and you can ask for a starting note.\n\nWhile performing make sure you show more than just singing. @Kyrsten_Marie96 The format is usually: \"My name is ______ and I'll be singing ____ from ___ (and if you have a monologue) and performing (either ____'s monologue or a monologue) from ______.\n\nBefore you do that, when you walk in, hand your music to the accompanist (if you have one). @Kyrsten_Marie96 You are always auditioning while in the rehearsal process (so if you've done a show with someone on the production team hopefully you were nice) and right when you walk in the door. Walk in shoulders up looking confident. Introduce yourself (we call it slating). @Kyrsten_Marie96 If you need a monologue you can find them online. The call should usually say how long they want that.\nIn the audition: make sure you are dressed business casual at least. Dressing up as the character is too far and stifles what they can see from you, but don't be too sloppy. @Kyrsten_Marie96 Third, figure out what they want (that should be first technically but I just remembered it). They may want a monologue as well and a certain cut. Follow these things exactly. Some theatres only like 30 seconds, some allow up to 1 minute and even 1:30. @Kyrsten_Marie96 First, you need to pick a song. Matilda is contemporary and kinda quirky and comedic. You can usually google songs to audition for _____.\nSecond, find a voice teacher for one or two sessions. If you do 2 they can find you a song, if you do one make sure you've already found one @Kyrsten_Marie96 If you need help still I can help @YourGingaNinja @sfosternyc @PattiLuPone @PattiMurin @SOPHIANNECARUSO @lesliekritzer @KerryButlerNyc @KRYSTAR0DRIGUEZ Barbara Streisand and Anne Hathaway really most Broadway actresses Ok so more like an hour and a half but I did it You want proof that I did it!!

Also, I just came out on Facebook. So #feelingstressedbutrelieved Dear Childhood,\nYou were cringy and very awkward but I grew from you. I figured out who I am. I wish I could change somethings about my childhood, but I grew from those experiences too. So hello adulthood I can't wait to live my life. Liked on YouTube: I'm Gay - Eugene Lee Yang https://t.co/dGtyfyFnMr We discussed ignorance in Davis County.\n\nI want everyone in Davis County to know that they need to learn to love. Your negative impact/ignorance can be destructive. Learn love. Right before I left while we were discussing mission questions I asked (I already knew) about what happens when someone has same-sex attraction and wants to go on their mission.\n\nI told my mom about what happened. My mom calmly comforted me. I know that she had my back. When I went to bed that night, I cried. I prayed to feel comfortable and I was comforted. I wanted to ask my leader if I could call my mom (we didn't have phones) and leave early. I didn't and stuck it out as I did in seminary.\n\nThe next day I had to leave early for work. When he asked if it was offensive I said it was, other people agreed with me thankfully. I couldn't stand up for myself there because of such homophobia. Other words were thrown, \"that's gay\", \"dude, you're gay\" and stuff like that. That didn't bother me like that extreme word. While playing cards with some people at a camp in my dorm room there was this kinda cute boy with a southern drawl who I was kinda crushing on. Within the first 2 minutes of our conversation, he said (thankfully not directly to me) the most offensive word to the gay community. I told him how I felt and he was my biggest supporter outside of the theatre community and my parents. He protected me from small homophobia.\n\nBut those scars that started to heal reopened this last Thursday night. I was scared about how things would go, but they went so well. I cried from feeling the spirit so strong. The things the people said in that class changed my heart and made me understand that God loved me more than I could imagine. I loved that class and that teacher. Then the second semester rolled around and I was thankful to get out of that seminary teachers class, at first I was terrified of this new teacher because of some things he had said during some summer seminary lessons. A few weeks later we had a lesson about LGBTQ+ matters. But I did because my parents didn't know I was gay at the time and wouldn't understand why seminary was hard. I become cold and unfeeling towards seminary and stopped caring at all, but still put on the persona of the \"perfect Mormon boy\" His words hurt my closeted soul and I felt hopeless and depressed. While he was teaching I had one of my friends from high school on the other end of a Snapchat message telling me I was loved and that I should leave the room. I didn't. I was scared. I didn't want to ever go back. I had a seminary teacher the first semester of my senior year who in one lesson was uneducated and said that Tom Christofferson was helped out of his gay relationship, which is false. He said that gay people can't be good parents, which is also false. I know that God loves me. I've gone through something similar earlier this year and made it out the other side, but not with some scars. And these experiences opened up those scars. Now that I'm out, I want to share what happened earlier and what we can learn. At that mission camp, I heard words said about all different types of people that should and hopefully, would never be said to people like that. Nobody there knew I was gay, and I hope that they wouldn't say what they said if they knew. I wanted to say that I was but couldn't. But parents need to teach their kids about love. As Gordon B. Hinckley said (this is paraphrased from what @tanfrance said in his SLC Book Tour): Christ said to love one another, not judging them based on who they are. Christ taught the sinner. They have no control over who chooses to live here. But what needs to happen is education. Parents already teach their kids how to act and behave and sometimes they forget that, but they are told by other adults (teachers, church leaders, older friends, etc.) It was that many of the kids were ignorant. Now I don't blame them. I blame the community that Davis County, Utah is. Because I live in \"Wonderbread Utah\" I know only a few out gay kids and less than 10 ethnic people. Now I don't blame the county for not having more diversity. This last Wednesday through Friday I had the wonderful experience of going to a missionary camp with my stake. It was a wonderfully powerful experience, but I want to reflect on something that wasn't right. It wasn't that the kids trashed the dorm rooms or staying out too late. Because these are some important thoughts I'm gonna keep them in this thread.

Hey @DallingaJj, Thank you for the follow! Hey @sarahlynn465, Thank you for the follow! Thanks to all my friends who were there and I can't wait for our future journeys (maybe together and maybe not). I hope I made an impact on your life and the lives of your children and I hope you teach them to love and support each other. (I'm legit crying right now). Thank you! And I'm excited to be a part of my friends' lives and being the gay person that their kids know and I hope to teach them about loving and respecting others no matter who they are. And if one day one of my best friends' kids turns out to be gay I'm there to be supportive. I am happy to not be one of those angry gay people in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who are angry that they'll never get married. I know my purpose in my life and I'm excited for all my straight friends to get married and have kids. As this school year comes to a close I was thinking about this. I am very happy with where I am in my life. I have figured out my sexuality and anxiety. @ellieryanh https://t.co/M7PGuJsiHf Liked on YouTube: 10 of the World's Smallest Products that Actually Work! https://t.co/680jWa4mTk RT @OriginalFunko: RT &amp; follow @OriginalFunko for a chance to WIN a @GameStop exclusive DC Collection Jim Lee Green Lantern and Batman Comi\u2026 RT @OriginalFunko: RT &amp; follow @OriginalFunko for a chance to WIN a @HotTopic exclusive Super Sized Dragon Ball Z Shenron (Jade) Pop! #DBZ\u2026 @WaitressMusical Sleeping in Hey @andyjwinder, Thank you for the follow!
