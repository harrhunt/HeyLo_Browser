Praying Daddy\u2019s surgery goes perfect \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb  I\u2019m so scared The reason we are really scared is because Daddy has an auto immune deficiency in his brain and has been on medication for months which suppresses the body from fighting back and makes surgery very risky\u2026 I truly can\u2019t believe this is happening. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m even typing this right now but our dog Daddy has to have immediate surgery &amp; has an abscess in his liver... \ud83d\ude1f The doctor just told Nate and I that he has a 50% chance of living\u2026 I\u2019m so fucking devastated and wish I could trade places with him right now RT @AndrewSiwicki: For several reasons... this video means a lot to me.
