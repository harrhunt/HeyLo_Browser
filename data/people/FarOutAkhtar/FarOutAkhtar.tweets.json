It\u2019s like saying you are disrespecting Ayurveda when you take an allopathic pill. Dear team at @niostwit .. please look into the inconsistency of your student application link. It more often that not shows the following error. (Image attached) It is very frustrating for students trying to make or complete online application forms. https://t.co/W5H6YYWyJh @PritishNandy Couldn\u2019t agree more. My question is more to do with the waste of time addressing such non issues. A nation will be known more for the character of its people than by the language they choose to (or not to) speak. Why is this even a thing? People have issues understanding each other even when they speak the same language.

I must get on with my life now... Jai Hind. @Abhishek_Mshra Yes that\u2019s what it\u2019s come to. Save money so that you can afford a few litres. Hahahahahaha .. you guys are so predictable with your career hitting threats .. #boring @chandragonsalve @Sootradhar I agree with you. The prices should be less .. in Maharashtra for eg. close to 45% of ticket value goes to the State as Entertainment tax. Imagine.. after paying income tax, service tax, now a high fuel tax, you also have to pay tax to be entertained. @Sootradhar I\u2019m sure you doubt it since it does not suit your narrative. You think a 4 year old ongoing debate is reason enough to burden the public today, I don\u2019t. We can agree to disagree. That\u2019s your reply??? #fail https://t.co/Z3GeBlRUdX Jiggs.. instead of offering me no-go experiment suggestions, why not use your seemingly sharp mind to come up with a formula to decrease the approx 120% added in collective tax, cess etc &amp; tag the Petroleum &amp; Finance Ministers (Central &amp; State)? #beuseful https://t.co/BZ6o25SJE3 @Abhayku9785 @JayeshRanade @INCIndia @ChinmayDatar Because we have to stop this us against them mindset.. it only deepens divides.

But I\u2019m good at thinking logically and for myself. @KainPradeep @TandonRaveena @jbond197 So according to you, our \u2018experts\u2019 are so short on ideas that past oil dues can only be generated by raising the price to overburden the end consumer??? Spare me your BS .. I\u2019m sure they can do better. @vadakkus You\u2019re memory fails you. I\u2019m not against the Metro at all. Never was. However, I do feel the shed doesn\u2019t need to be in Aarey and destroy hectares of green cover that our city desperately needs. @saveaarey @deepakmota1 Please don\u2019t buy the ticket or the popcorn. It\u2019s not an essential commodity and it will not raise the price of vegetables and food grain in days to come. High fuel prices will. @ankush_ks Aisa kyon mere bhai.. only politicians use fuel, is it?? \u20b984 per litre mubarak to you and your loved ones. \nActual cost I believe is \u20b931, based on info i could find online (do correct me if I\u2019m wrong, happy to learn) .. the rest are central &amp; state taxes,  cess &amp; commissions.
