Not just one person I wish I was there to celebrate with you and the fam on your buffday @rihanna @jennnrosales @melissaforde11 till next time.... thine will do body shots till the sun comes up https://t.co/JX2wiwTlMZ Taking the new year back to the (Nova) 90s.\u2728 pumasportstyle #ad https://t.co/bopgsWjkTj @jameelajamil Thank you. I only went on twitter because a lot of people close to him were so hurt by what you said so I had to say something. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that. Sending you love and best wishes in return. Just asking for some sensitivity at this time @jameelajamil I am glad that we can have this open conversation without trying to attack each other, it\u2019s just very raw for a lot of people, me included. I am going to step away. I am sending nothing but love and I hope you feel the same @jameelajamil All I ask is that you consider those who are hurting right now and leave some space for that before discussing the issues that need to be. That\u2019s all @jameelajamil I agree but what you are saying you must understand is upsetting me greatly. I am grieving someone who was special to me. It\u2019s very tough to have this conversation without getting emotional. @jameelajamil You can not compare Harvey to Karl! Especially to me @jameelajamil Please trust me, I am doing the best that I can my dear and all of these things NEED to be addressed. As we all know, annoyingly, change takes time. I wish it didn\u2019t @jameelajamil I agree with you but please don\u2019t call him a bad human, that is simply not fair. We should be talking about the people alive, in power, ruling the world who are hurting, destroying far more lives than this man who has passed only yesterday. @jameelajamil Honest yes and this should be a general dicussion which should be spoken about outside of just him. He is not the problem. The  way the world is... and the way the industry has been for a long time. It\u2019s time for change and I agree with that @jameelajamil It saddens me deeply that anyone was hurt, that I do not condone. It is not possible to go through life without hurting people. He was not a saint, he is a human being like all of us who made mistakes and we should all have the chance to be forgiven for that @jameelajamil I understand what you were trying to do and I apologize if I offended you or anyone else. I just don\u2019t feel that living in the past and bringing up things that have already happened helps anything. Let\u2019s move forward and lead with love. That\u2019s it... All of these things should have been addressed while someone is living, not the day after someones death Everyone has their own opinion and I felt the need to voice my own. All I want is for everyone to love each other no matter what. Just please understand that it\u2019s an extremely emotional time and we must try use love instead of hate The face you make when you are asked to be a judge on @rupaulsdragrace COMING SOON... https://t.co/3EISumP06h \u2764\ufe0fForever\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/tKsYogmRt2 I wish I had been able to tell you how much you meant to me.

Outside of fashion, he was one of the most interesting and caring men I have ever met. Every time I try and write about this man, all i do is cry.

No one should be made to feel like that https://t.co/LF0VqHsBhY I am definitely stopping now, I am not trying to moan, just being honest about how I feel. Sleep well, sweet dreams x Some of you are definitely worse than others and I promise that it will come back around to bite you, if not, I CERTAINLY WILL! I refuse to let these grown men treat people like objects with no feelings and get away with it, I will never be silent. Sorry guys, rant over. I hope you all had a great day. If I wasn't able to vent to you guys, these situations would probably end in violence And also, to answer your question, I did have a great night last night. Thank you! I definitely had a better night than you x Then let's see who is laughing One day when I have time, I will find out where you live and camp outside your house with my friends armed with cameras If not then I feel truly sorry for you If only I could make you feel the way you make me feel, I just hope that outside of this, you are able to feel empathy for others. I was excited to be in Milan but now I have a feeling you are going to ruin my trip. Also to the guys in Milan! I only cover my face when you are rude to me, please do not make me feel like a zoo animal The paparazzi only get worse!
