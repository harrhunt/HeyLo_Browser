Thanks to @Selkoe  and @Karmaloop for providing the clothes. .@OhSoDetermined @iTunesTrailers @DopeMovie Yes, I think everyone, regardless of age or color, will find something to relate to in our movie .@katieturner981 @iTunesTrailers Grateful to everyone who worked on @DopeMovie, we all believed we were creating something uniquely special. .@katieturner981 @iTunesTrailers Indie filmmaking isn't easy, we didn't have the luxury of a big Hollywood studio to make this film... .@Caoimhe_Foran The '90s were an incredible era for all kinds of music. Grunge, hip hop, etc. So many unique voices, there's lots to love. .@Joehernandez201 YES! .@angelAmyV Very comfortable. We recorded #Awreeoh's four songs for @DopeMovie in two days. .@_deargirl @DopeMovie Staying true to yourself, regardless of your circumstances or people's perceptions. .@RajjKalsi @iTunesTrailers @DopeMovie So many, but I love National Lampoon's Vacation, especially the @ChevyChaseToGo character. .@Solomoney There's an army involved in producing a movie! @MimiValdes @ForestWhitaker @NYBongiovi @iamdiddy and the whole @DopeMovie crew. .@iTunesTrailers All of them! \ud83d\ude1c .@iTunesTrailers You're communicating characters, emotions or story arcs through sound. It can be very challenging, but it was super fun. .@iTunesTrailers Recording an album is a different experience. With film, you're telling a story through music that isn't necessarily yours. .@iTunesTrailers Of course, there's a bit of N.E.R.D. in the #Awreeoh songs too, @RickFamuyiwa wanted that sound. .@iTunesTrailers They're more like a hip hop punk band. #Awreeoh was inspired by the angst of these characters and how they see the world. .@iTunesTrailers @meaksworld @TonyRevolori @KierseyClemons They're incredibly talented. Funny, confident and very OTHER. .@iTunesTrailers When @RickFamuyiwa told us about his idea for Dope, b4 there was a script, @i_am_OTHER immediately wanted to get involved. .@iTunesTrailers Hi, thanks for having me.
