Sometimes, some lessons are learned best th\u2026 RT @22emilynicole: \"You do not fall in love, you create love.\" #LDSface2face You might never know the answer to a question. The lord only reveals things in his own dew time Keep pressing forward and you'll get through the doubts you have b You know enough for the things that the lord is going to put you through. Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith! You don't have to walk the path alone. I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. The worst mistake you can make is to not turn to the lord to help you through your mistakes. RT @LizaE14: Sometimes it's just touching how well someone knows you.

RT @LDSquotable: \"If it invites and entices to do good, it comes from Christ. And we ought to do it.\" \u2014 David A. Bednar The lord is by our side loving us and guiding us in our decisions. The answer may not come all at once, but keep pressing forward and seek the rest of the answer. Sorry, not sorry, for the spiritual tweets overload. If it invites and indices to do good, then it is from Christ. The mission field is the best place to learn. Both spiritual and secular. Seek learning by faith We can get heavenly help in learning the gospel. When you have the light of Christ in your eyes, you are beautiful. Ask the lord to help you get rid of those bad thoughts. He's the best at helping. I hate being crippled. I honestly just want to go to the temple. It's only a sin if you don't cast out that bad image or thought. So cast it out. Have faith to open your mouth and declare the good news Sometimes your example is the only scriptures a person ever reads.
