Really really cool unique stuff. X Also, \"colour\" is the Canadian spelling! The fact that we feel lost and empty without music means that we are so much creatures of creativity and colour, not to mention we make it! The best part is is not how incredible music is but how incredible we are.. Life is blank and silent without music! If i have it off for more than an hour i feel empty! It does that to us! Insane.
