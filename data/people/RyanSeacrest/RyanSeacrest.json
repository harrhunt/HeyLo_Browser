Thanks @TaylorSwift13 for catching up with us! #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest https://t.co/g8xAzmPu2C @taylorswift13 .@TaylorSwift13's not sure if she'll play #Lover in stadiums. She wants to make it feel intimate: \u201cMy goal for whatever live setting that we decide to do things in...I'm going to try to make it smaller and feel like a living room as much as I possibly can.\u201d #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest @taylorswift13 On the plus side, more time to plan = a better experience for fans: \u201cI want to give them 113% every show so I need for it to be in a way that feels right.\u201d #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest @taylorswift13 Why she told her team to hold off #Lover tour plans:  \u201cI literally just took my tights off and my thigh-high boots off from the last tour ...

This whole phase of my life is very much about freedom and the #Lover album to me completely represents freedom.\u201d #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest If @TaylorSwift13 will re-record her past albums differently, she tells me: \u201cI\u2019m really going to be listening to the fans because there are some amazing ideas that they\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nHere you go #Swifties. Time to submit those ideas. #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest On getting the best album reviews she's ever received with #Lover, she says: \"It gets me emotional even talking about it.
