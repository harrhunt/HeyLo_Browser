Creators will have to identify content made for kids, and we\u2019ll additionally find videos in this category using machine learning. 3. Features like comments and notifications will no longer be available on videos made for kids. 2. Personalized ads will stop running on content made for kids. 1. We will treat data from anyone watching children\u2019s content on https://t.co/alxrZsi5Vw as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the user. This means we will only collect the data needed to support the operation of the service. Today we\u2019re sharing several changes designed to better protect data on children\u2019s content on YouTube. Starting in about four months: \"I can't even make a DiGornio pizza.\" \u2014 @DavidDobrik. \n\nLet's see how well David keeps up with @bonappetit \ud83d\ude05https://t.co/hdB0a7QWKD https://t.co/IG7fKONKB9 Tips for easy living, clean eating and home organization courtesy of #CreatorOnTheRise Kyra Ann. \u2192 https://t.co/Q2OOCAHoTg https://t.co/P9QWCzAF8x For all of those with Euphoria shaped holes in your heart on Sundays. \ud83d\udc94 Watch @daisymarquez_ tutorial. \u2192 https://t.co/tSdGsAoeKh https://t.co/Otr1jrFiNd But can we get this collab? https://t.co/dnrrWRYxXx @kevleeb @MrBeastYT never heard of it.
