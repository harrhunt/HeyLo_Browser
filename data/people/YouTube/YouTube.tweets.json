What else you got? https://t.co/3SgoMbrStq 9.5.2019 \ud83d\udc83 https://t.co/9Tm0tjszjE More about why we\u2019re making these changes here: https://t.co/yPHApGxF6l We know a lot of parents and kids watch YouTube together, but for kids watching alone, we recommend using the YouTube Kids app. It\u2019s been available since 2015, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in it with more parental controls and a higher bar for qualifying channels. 4. Creators will have to identify content made for kids, and we\u2019ll additionally find videos in this category using machine learning. 3. Features like comments and notifications will no longer be available on videos made for kids. 2. Personalized ads will stop running on content made for kids. 1. We will treat data from anyone watching children\u2019s content on https://t.co/alxrZsi5Vw as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the user. This means we will only collect the data needed to support the operation of the service. Today we\u2019re sharing several changes designed to better protect data on children\u2019s content on YouTube.
