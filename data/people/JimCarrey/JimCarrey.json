They say mercury in fish is dangerous but forcing all of our children to be injected with mercury in thimerosol is no risk. Make sense?

I'm not. ;^\\ I hope the end of the Myan calender is at least an end to the selfishness that puts assault rifles into the hands of dangerous ppl. ENOUGH!

My heart goes out to them. ;^\\ Everything in life is dancing around on a bed of calm silence.No matter how chaotic the surface is, a stillness lies underneath.S'good. ;^} If you really study Mitt Romney's fake humble caring friend to all mankind face, it's hard to miss the glaring insincerity of the man. ;^P 1 thing that's always missing frm the republican agenda, compassion toward your fellow man.With Obama I'll pay more but I'll sleep well. ;^} I'm sick of new Apple icrap! Gee, ihope the new ipad isn't so thin that my finger breaks through when iwipe my APPLE OWNED ASS WITH IT!  8^Q I don't trust politicians much but i prefer Obama.Despite insane partisan resistance n enormous challenges he's done surprisingly well. ;^) Time 4 the 3rd debate, the political eqivalent of driving past a street corner several times to make sure u choose the least skanky ho! ;^) Goodmornoonevening world.
