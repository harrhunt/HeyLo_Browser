We always have fun re-playing the previous game just before the new one comes out. Approach with extreme caution. Take on the murderous Owlhoot family in Red Dead Online\u2019s latest Legendary Bounty Mission. \n\nAvailable until October 7: https://t.co/3cllu4JrOh https://t.co/kWXl9XAvCm @PS_Eire_Dylan18 We had a lot of fun going back and giving that another play through. Especially after learning John's backstory. @MadMontyMN Once you really get the hang of the controls you start to be able to do the really fun stuff. https://t.co/ChBBsTjrfN @43Silencer Nice! We were thinking No Man's Sky-are, but it might be a stretch. @DurcanDonuts It's one of those games that takes a little while to get going, but it's well worth it. @LambentHammerB Having a buddy by your side improves any experience. https://t.co/m9c9wsTBCW @ThunderbyrdLive The random encounters also added another variable! We usually like helping people out, but a couple of those could turn dangerous if you let your guard down. @juk52011 It's easy to miss things the first time! Witcher games are always well worth another play. @rhysholt1 Jack will always be one of our favorite robots friends. https://t.co/jiRCyMuYPx @Meyrick94 Sometimes it's just the right game for the right time. @marlonb1984 First time we were Moze and now playing as FL4K. Love his pets! https://t.co/3PbcSzM3kT @Brad_Artych Sometimes the Witcher games can almost be overwhelming. You've got it be ready to give them lots of attention. @skeppyluv Forza Horrorizon 4 https://t.co/GkOrWWYDZc RT @WatchMixer: Squad up with Team @Xbox as they take on a Ghost-gone-rogue in Tom Clancy's #GhostReconBreakpoint!\n\nLIVE: https://t.co/CdrK\u2026 @ZephyrStormBorn Well, with Borderlands you have to do at least one playthrough with each character. https://t.co/6hm54Fx4EQ @bradysharp12 Would you kindly... play Bioshock again? @ThunderbyrdLive Red Dead Redemption 2 has so much to discover. Depending on your choices you can have really different experiences on each playthrough too. https://t.co/xI3N8TNjw6 @fearthrower The code should come to you in your Xbox messenger. It might take up to two weeks. @bret_owen99 This seems to be a really common answer! It's almost like The Witcher 3 is a massive, incredibly detailed game or something. @BKinggamer It's one of those games that is just too stunning to catch everything the first time. @0kuyasunijimura NG+ is always a whole new experience. https://t.co/NHIofvYj0Q @lukashi_sensie Some games get better when you really get into the backstory. Reach was definitely one of those! @EternalSling They made some pretty serious updates for Season 2. https://t.co/Ea1X6viMlo Home grown \ud83c\udfae\n\nSave big on Xbox Game Studios titles: https://t.co/5ljijh3OZI https://t.co/tuV9UdKNyn @Havoc50K Do you prefer the \"start from scratch, just harder\" or \"keep all your stuff\" versions of NG+? @RonanTheVillain That's a good one! https://t.co/ZHs1Gsnjrr @KajanPetit Knowing the lore and getting more invested makes every Witcher game that much more engrossing. @rhysholt1 It's fun trying to find all the components for Jack's upgrades too. @TwitterGaming Boo-derlands 3 https://t.co/fnjPcuYbIz @MikeyLowe6 Hard to do anything bad around this good boy. https://t.co/ZZdr3Dg0N1 @MBoy_10 What do you think changed for you that made it better the second time around? @ButterflyDraws We loved it the first time, and the next time it was even better. @ITSUPPORTBRYAN Nice! Playing it on the Master Chief Collection? @thatmantaz We're been super excited for the updates that just came out.  So many new things to do! @Riident 1st time: \"How do I shoot aliens?\"\n2nd time: \"WHY do I shoot aliens?\" Your squad just got a lot bigger.

Got to show him where it all began. https://t.co/JvugjKeUKX @Paper_Cut11 Between the positive community and how beautiful the game is, it is an awesome game to stream. https://t.co/WESZjhFDZy @IpsilonTheBard We tell ourselves on the second playthrough we'll be evil, but end up feeling too guilty. https://t.co/iT4AhAdYHi @albinomachina Playing co-op with someone else makes a game more special. Did you and your son play the other Halo games together? @MrLJDennis Such an amazing series and the story has a lot of depth. Loved Elizabeth's character development in Bioshock Infinite. https://t.co/HTgsqALhlN @ChrisNajar Well, technically the T-800's already in it. So just him without any skin? @CastTonSetUp We definitely need to replay that one. @EpicGamingAU We got a little spooked just watching the clip! @Paper_Cut11 Photo mode is awesome.

Thanks for sharing the clip! @Staggerilla That is some seriously retro gameplay! Which game has the best single player campaign? @DyspraxicRob An \"emotional rollercoaster\" assumes that there are ups to go with the downs.
