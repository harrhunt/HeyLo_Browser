So much to find! @AwesomeC08 Afraid not, this offer is only available to new subscribers of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. @The_Michelle620 How often is he instalocked in the select screen? @LadyAlexiel22 Both game narrations make you feel like you're part of the story. Wonder if part of that is due to the horror themes. @LadyAlexiel22 Right there with you! The next time we play, we're going to focus more on using photo mode. @LadyAlexiel22 Especially the way they built up the final battle. We were not ready to let go. @LadyAlexiel22 Missed a few in the beginning because we were on edge wondering when the next battle would come. https://t.co/5lKhhmugvB @CavAlbie Love the foggy background and the tree's reflection on the car. https://t.co/rDNGjRVtB4 @LadyAlexiel22 There are so many little details that immerse you into the game. The Lorestones were a big part of that and how Senua interacted with the voices. RT @Borderlands: It\u2019s been 10 years since Borderlands first made its debut in October 2009.

How'd the stream go? @LadyAlexiel22 All those have great stories and are worth another playthrough or 5. @ZephyrStormBorn Sounds like you're an expert! https://t.co/t3tUfLmV0p @NickPick_13 Sounds like! We always have fun re-playing the previous game just before the new one comes out. Approach with extreme caution.

Especially after learning John's backstory. @MadMontyMN Once you really get the hang of the controls you start to be able to do the really fun stuff. https://t.co/ChBBsTjrfN @43Silencer Nice! We were thinking No Man's Sky-are, but it might be a stretch. @DurcanDonuts It's one of those games that takes a little while to get going, but it's well worth it. @LambentHammerB Having a buddy by your side improves any experience. https://t.co/m9c9wsTBCW @ThunderbyrdLive The random encounters also added another variable! We usually like helping people out, but a couple of those could turn dangerous if you let your guard down. @juk52011 It's easy to miss things the first time! Witcher games are always well worth another play. @rhysholt1 Jack will always be one of our favorite robots friends. https://t.co/jiRCyMuYPx @Meyrick94 Sometimes it's just the right game for the right time. @marlonb1984 First time we were Moze and now playing as FL4K.

Depending on your choices you can have really different experiences on each playthrough too. https://t.co/xI3N8TNjw6 @fearthrower The code should come to you in your Xbox messenger. It might take up to two weeks. @bret_owen99 This seems to be a really common answer! It's almost like The Witcher 3 is a massive, incredibly detailed game or something. @BKinggamer It's one of those games that is just too stunning to catch everything the first time. @0kuyasunijimura NG+ is always a whole new experience. https://t.co/NHIofvYj0Q @lukashi_sensie Some games get better when you really get into the backstory.

How did we not make that connection? https://t.co/yqBs1thvBc @DaeshawnBallard We were too charmed by his sass. @IIIWeldXV Yes, Shadowkeep will be standard price, but the only expansion not included in the free package (Forsaken) will be reduced in price. @DaeshawnBallard We had Solas as one of the main members of our team. What a twist for his character at the end! https://t.co/NVOkfEnci6 @OfficialMarkLaw Nothing like a good flamethrower to help you conquer your fears. https://t.co/PwjTVMOf9E @Slietaert1 Our highlight was when Morrigan considered us a friend. https://t.co/sl5m6m9cV5 @DaeshawnBallard Heavy Rain is intense!

Thanks for sharing the clip. @mcavanah You can say Last of Us. Just don't make us fight any Clickers. @photo_gt97 @Kathy_15xx We absolutely agree! @XX330_XX We're not seeing the option to buy it digitally, but if you can find a physical copy it should work on your Xbox One. @2FlyGamin Well, it turned out flawlessly. Thanks for sharing the clip! @Staggerilla That is some seriously retro gameplay! Which game has the best single player campaign? @DyspraxicRob An \"emotional rollercoaster\" assumes that there are ups to go with the downs.  That's not the kind of game What Remains of Edith Finch is. @rectanglechips Very same! We're so hyped for it. @blletsolspeaks It's time to get. that. loot. https://t.co/tWy0Sl3F8w @XX330_XX It already is! https://t.co/PF4bqY4X2d @ObiBertKenobi Borderlands streams all day!
