Today the reason presented itself loud &amp; clear.

We\u2019re going to feel a bunch of feelings we might not want to feel. Face the feelings head on and most importantly, tell yourself nothing but the TRUTH. Progression starts with the truth Finally getting out of a mental rut... sometimes it takes a while to recognize what your problem is and admit that you\u2019re lying to yourself about something. I\u2019m totally fine, just happy that I\u2019m learning everyday, even if it\u2019s from my mistakes \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f @innocentgrayson Love ya @twaimz @GraysonDolan Yay:) glad u like I laugh at the most stupid shit Needa do somethin spontaneous today I\u2019m tired of being bored I went to a store today right after Grayson did and the guy at the register said \u201cyou look like a guy who was just here, just not as buff\u201d \n\n................ \ud83d\ude16 @RickyPDillon @GraysonDolan HAHAHAHAHAHA Yea fuck ever being separated ever again https://t.co/VehjDfE8N1 Got him \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps://t.co/BH317WfmEz Happy birthday sis \u2764\ufe0f Some fuck shit happened to me today....

Don\u2019t continue the negative chain, if someone is an asshole to you, go make someone else\u2019s day \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc99 I\u2019m not offended or anything, negative words are just a result of people being overwhelmed by their own problems and insecurities being built up. Just sad about those little kids having to grow up in that negative enviroment with such irrational and immature role models. A car just pulled up beside me and yelled discriminatory slurs at me for actually no reason. They had children in the backseat, and I was really disappointed to see the bad example they were setting for them. Always make sure to set a good example. Kids are the future Really feeling like myself lately:) Grayson just tried to start a fire with a taser and burnt some of his hair off... Sometimes I wanna be an astronaut. Is it possible to do that part time? I still wanna make videos but also be an astronaut Gray and I just officially started a project we\u2019re extremely excited about and never thought we\u2019d actually be able to do.

If you want to do something, go after it NOW. There is no time to waste, no time to second guess, and no limits. This world is fucked. Don\u2019t lose hope though RIP xxxtentacion, regardless of his controversial past, he did not deserve to die, especially so young. I respected him for preaching/spreading positivity and the lives he touched in a positive way. Gone too soon, so terrible. His music/art will live forever.

I get out there and HE DIDNT HAVE THE KEY IN WTF. Idk if I get mad about this or feel bad for him idk Just ate way too much ice cream I was driving behind a car and because of how slow the car was moving I immediately thought it was a grandma. So I pulled up next to the car at the red light ready to finesse an old lady\u2019s number, but it was just Grayson... :/ Grayson drives soo SLOW Ready for it to be warm out... or maybe I\u2019ll just go somewhere where it is \ud83e\udd28 Somewhere FAR very soon\ud83e\udd14 I just took a nap and Grayson rearranged our whole room?! I\u2019m in my bed on the other side of the room rn wtf when did I tell him this was okay vids up:) \n\nhttps://t.co/TPBsohtRT4\n\nThank you all. We did some random giveaways and surprises in this video\ud83e\udd14 Hey guys, thank u all for your supports and being understanding.\nThere WILL be a video today, so...... happy Tuesday\ud83d\ude0a I\u2019ve never been into glorifying a sub count b/c it doesn\u2019t make you better than anyone else, but I am beyond thankful that 5 million people consider having me as part of their lives. I respect you all so much- wish I could hang with u all at some point in my life u guys are cool Just did the craziest shit I\u2019ve ever done in my life Guys it\u2019s up!!\n\nhttps://t.co/mnMZQCRkJg\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting to make a vid like this for the longest time. We had a lot of fun with it hope you like it!:) today\u2019s vid is a special one If you believe people are less than you do to their skin color, ethnic background, OR HOW THEY WERE BORN, please unfollow me, you are not welcomed here. For the rest of you, love you and continue to lift each other up. We\u2019re are all human \ud83d\udc99 I\u2019ve seen posts stating I have been avoiding commenting on this issue.. which is false. If I see something like this I will address it immediately. Just because I\u2019m not on my phone all day, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m running away from an issue that needs to be resolved Hey guys. I\u2019m seeing a lot of discussion about racism in my notifications. Also seeing some false accusations about myself for some reason.. please know that racism is something that I will never tolerate. It\u2019s disgusting and I can\u2019t believe it still exists. My dad came out to cali today glad he was able to make it out here:) Gray and I are planning on going somewhere very far soon \u2708\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14 We\u2019re all the same I have to pee so bad and Grayson\u2019s driving so slow AHHHH get me tfo Grayson is such a little bitch with scary movies no way we\u2019re identical I need some new pants Excited for tomorrow\ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s up! Bloopers 2017. \n\nhttps://t.co/yOdmzcPxui Uploading now! The video should be up very soon I\u2019m going to speak up and use my voice from now on. I\u2019m tired of people steering this generation in the wrong direction. Not at all saying that I control an entire genertation, but with the gift of this platform I\u2019ve been given, it\u2019s the least I can do. The horrible measures people will go to in order to have content to stay relevant is absolutely disgusting. Being blinded by your ego so much so that thinking it is okay to make insensitive remarks about suicide, and broadcasting it for millions of CHILDREN to see is sickening. I\u2019m in disbelief right now 2017 actually kinda sucked in the beginning but your constant support def helped turn it around for me so thank u for that :) let\u2019s all have a great 2018 Happy NEW yeaR my resolution is to idk Can\u2019t go into 2018 without a 2017 DT blooper reel? Grayson ditched me and went snowboarding today. He\u2019s not a caring brother like he portrays himself to be online! Exposed!

And I also lost my wallet WOOOOOO I'm not subtweeting, I'm just speaking in general. Some friendships aren't always perfect/don't necessarily last forever, but life goes on Since we don't like to promote drama, we end up getting accused of dropping people and using them when gray and I aren't like that at all I'm over seeing people accuse gray and I of \"dropping friends.\" We wouldn't just not be friends with someone unless something went wrong Yo I'm not tryna be negative. Good vibes always, I just wanna say something that I feel I kinda need to talk about your brain is admirable https://t.co/zt2WcdM98y I love seeing you guys supporting each other.
