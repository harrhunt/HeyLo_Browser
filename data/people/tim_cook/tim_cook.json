Hope you enjoy! \ud83c\udf89 https://t.co/HrdLRtgU10 Thank you @LanaDelRey and everyone who helped make today\u2019s #AppleEvent unforgettable. We\u2019re excited to see what people around the world create with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Air and Mac mini! https://t.co/bELvK5VvlJ Good morning New York! We\u2019re looking forward to an exciting day at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. See you in a few hours! https://t.co/MvyyAemoIj Great to be back in NYC. See you tomorrow morning in Brooklyn! #shotoniphoneXR https://t.co/98XxwjMMAw On this Sunday morning, let us remember the words of Martin Luther King, \u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d Our hearts are with the Tree of Life community, first responders and the families of those tragically lost in Pittsburgh today. We must reject intolerance and hate if we are ever to find peace in our world. After 20 years, Matthew Shepard is going to his final resting place\u2014where his life will be celebrated, his loss mourned and his memory preserved. An important reminder that darkness may win temporary victories, but light will always find a way to shine. Buongiorno Piazza Liberty! Milan is one of my favorite cities and I am very happy to be here with you today. Around the world, we hope everyone is enjoying the new iPhone XR! https://t.co/hmJb8yrNCM Our teams here in Madrid and all around the world are gearing up for Friday\u2019s launch of iPhone XR. Thanks for stopping by, @rosaliavt! https://t.co/3YsBkNo8bB La m\u00fasica corre por nuestras venas. Thank you for making HomePod\u2019s launch in Spain extra special, @rosaliavt!  Your new album is phenomenal. https://t.co/VnJARrgV9X Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn\u2019t want to do great things. It doesn\u2019t want anything. That part takes all of us. We are optimistic about technology\u2019s awesome potential for good \u2014 but we know that it won\u2019t happen on its own. And fourth, everyone has a right to the security of their data. Security is at the heart of all data privacy and privacy rights. Third, companies should recognize that data belongs to users and we should make it easy for people to get a copy of their personal data, as well as correct and delete it. Second, users should always know what data is being collected from them and what it\u2019s being collected for. This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t. Anything less is a sham. First, companies should challenge themselves to de-identify customer data or not collect that data in the first place. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. No matter what country you live in, that right should be protected in keeping with four essential principles: GDPR has shown us all that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. It was an honor to be invited to #ICDPPC2018 in Brussels this morning. I\u2019d like to share a bit of what I said to this gathering of privacy regulators from around the world. It all boils down to a fundamental question: What kind of world do we want to live in? Proud to announce our new training program in partnership with France\u2019s @simplonco, teaching the basics of coding with Swift. Learning to code unlocks a world of creativity and potential. Thanks to the staff and trainees for a warm welcome this morning!\nhttps://t.co/e0xpnhA1NO A profoundly moving visit to @aartistesenexil in Paris.

We send our deepest condolences to Paul\u2019s friends, the Allen family and everyone at Microsoft. Apple is standing with our friends and neighbors in the Gulf Coast region, and will be donating to recovery and relief efforts. I grew up on the shores of the Gulf Coast, near Pensacola and Mobile, and that region holds a special place in my heart. That\u2019s never been more true than now. To all those communities in the path of Hurricane Michael, you are in my prayers. Please stay safe. Teachers around the world inspire us every day.

That vision endures, and his example guides us today. #IHaveADream https://t.co/TSTLzAYyUp We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men \u2014 and women \u2014 are created equal.
