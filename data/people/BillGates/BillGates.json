minds on seemingly intractable problems. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to tackle one of the defining technical challenges of our time. https://t.co/F2Wd8vM4ia This is one of the most important topics in medicine today: how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment. https://t.co/hcji8sAhmy The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE. https://t.co/80j0A3MyJg Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar. https://t.co/a3gcP3M2HV Tackling the world\u2019s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership. https://t.co/85nrN9FFS2 Congrats to the 2019 winners of the @NobelPrize in chemistry! Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery, and the quest to build a better one is an important step in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/8XrKz2Zw1s Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World\u2019s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition. https://t.co/rpwu3XuuGt The world\u2019s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I\u2019m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem: https://t.co/H7KrSXFo4b https://t.co/1QJg3gyJZY Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year\u2019s @NobelPrize in economics. I\u2019ve learned a lot from their pioneering work to better understand the complexities of the lives of the world\u2019s poorest people. https://t.co/Uc0XeytGRs The world is facing a crisis at the dinner table, one that climate change will only worsen. I\u2019m optimistic about the progress being made by @RIPEproject on a much-needed breakthrough. https://t.co/pzM61gDdWE The odds of dying of AIDS in South Africa are less than half what they were at the peak. That progress wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the @GlobalFund and other global health organizations. Even more progress is possible if we keep up the fight: https://t.co/71W2exSVZT https://t.co/f2gJwuIb9H We need more approaches to stopping #Alzheimers disease. I\u2019m excited to see this news out of @DZNE_de and @ISD_Research about a promising starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies. https://t.co/zj81EbL7X6 I\u2019m impressed by the international cooperation that made this year\u2019s @GlobalFund Replenishment round possible. The world has committed more than ever before. Our foundation is proud to commit $700 million to over the next 3 years. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/mfuamNyygd I can\u2019t think of a more fitting tribute to Hans Rosling and his life\u2019s work. Hans was a dear friend to Melinda and me \u2013 and inspired us all with his passion, intelligence, and wit. https://t.co/gYfioNQBuW I\u2019m in Lyon, France for the @GlobalFund\u2019s replenishment \u2013 celebrating the most money ever raised for their life-saving work. I\u2019m excited for the day that these diseases are in the history books. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/isnpGkyNWE In Afghanistan, one of the last countries with polio, vaccine acceptance rates have reached 98% thanks to the tireless work of female health workers. Their increased involvement and passion is why polio eradication is within reach in Afghanistan. https://t.co/v2yPVeSCiz If all countries in the world had the same concentration of researchers as wealthy ones, there would be 3x as many researchers. That\u2019s mind-blowing. We all lose out when talent isn\u2019t connected with opportunity. @OurWorldInData https://t.co/a9m56tDdLp Malnutrition is the greatest health inequity in the world. I recently spoke with my friend @AlikoDangote about how we can use iodized salt to help kids gets the nutrients they need: https://t.co/PXp3WeJfEy https://t.co/qpQ51LWZuf I\u2019m lucky to have known Stephen Hawking \u2014 and he was as exceptional in person as you imagined he was. As remarkable as his contributions to physics were, his biggest accomplishment was inspiring the world to believe in the magic of science and research. https://t.co/FxiyzmBTuz Here is the story of the day I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and the influence of someone who\u2019s been a critical guide along the way: https://t.co/KWOicXCab6 https://t.co/R62eDi82yG @TheEconomist is right: climate change touches everything and everyone -- and, unfairly, the poor and marginalized have the most to lose. \n\nIf you want to understand what can be done, I highly recommend you read this issue. https://t.co/3JZS3WsAzQ Melinda's work on behalf of women and girls around the world inspires me every day. She's committing $1 billion over the next ten years to increasing women's power and influence in the United States. Because #EqualityCantWait. https://t.co/QHnPyAeN59 I\u2019m delighted that @erna_solberg has re-upped Norway\u2019s commitment to support the work of the @GlobalFund. I welcome her sustained leadership and partnership in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. https://t.co/2NTVVpmEul Most people know @AlikoDangote as Africa\u2019s wealthiest man, but I know him as one of our foundation\u2019s most impactful partners in improving health. Melinda and I are lucky to count him as a partner (and friend!) in our work. https://t.co/9Pk8seLGpi More and more children are living to see their 5th birthdays. That\u2019s because the world has made incredible progress in reducing child mortality. But progress has been uneven. We have more work to do to close the gaps across countries and within them. https://t.co/TaeiqkLD0U It's really incredible how much time and effort goes into producing a documentary like the new @netflix series I participated in. I shared more about the experience on my blog: https://t.co/BgTeiguaFf https://t.co/UzqI251nxU Ending poverty and achieving the SDGs requires a whole-of-government approach. @ImranKhanPTI and @SaniaNishtar have shown leadership in developing a new anti-poverty strategy. #Ehsaas https://t.co/tbRNz4Gbf6 .@sanchezcastejon\u2019s commitment to the @GlobalFund reflects Spain\u2019s leadership. At a time when more countries are turning inward, Spain is showing that we can\u2019t back away from our commitment to fighting poverty and disease. https://t.co/H0ffOpSGr9 RT @gatesfoundation: The third annual #Goalkeepers19 event brings together a new generation of changemakers to accelerate progress toward t\u2026 Sanitation is a difficult issue to take on because there are no easy solutions. Tonight we recognized the progress India has made on this issue through its Swachh Bharat program, under the leadership of @narendramodi. https://t.co/liTmmHl7ap I had the privilege of meeting @DrElvisEze at last year\u2019s Malaria Summit in London, and I was struck by his optimism about the fight against malaria. I think you\u2019ll be inspired by his story. https://t.co/92006G0AtA I\u2019m excited to see world leaders and climate advocates coming together to make progress at the UNGA #ClimateAction Summit. Working together we can prevent the worst effects of climate change. https://t.co/AHOwRfmk0i I\u2019ve always loved playing tennis. Maybe this is why. See more deleted scenes from the @netflix series about my life and read exclusive stories on my blog: https://t.co/bjWwDvqQkc https://t.co/HquaH9PrBc I am hopeful that we can substantially alter the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, join me in supporting Alzheimer\u2019s research by watching and sharing @AlzResearchUK\u2019s #SharetheOrange video with @SamuelLJackson. https://t.co/5Gl8hWHXtA The docuseries about my life and work is out today. I hope you\u2019ll check it out on @netflix \u2014 and then read some of the stories that didn\u2019t make the cut on my blog. https://t.co/G6BfXXK93I Adapting to climate change requires support from governments and businesses to ensure those most at risk have the opportunity to thrive. A new report from @GCAdaptation lays out steps we can take to address this urgent issue. https://t.co/QWEGBqY3Vl The new docuseries that looks at my work is out tomorrow. I hope you check it out on @netflix. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you think: https://t.co/1UXX3xEja5. https://t.co/ZortFamUF0 As governments invest more in primary health care systems, overall health outcomes improve. Here\u2019s how: https://t.co/GqQ8EHynUP https://t.co/gBtqPBh8Vw Melinda and I started out ahead. But hundreds of millions of people around the world have to overcome hurdle after hurdle to be successful. Read about how advocates are working to even the odds for everyone: https://t.co/w0DQYCunTK https://t.co/NGmF01h66W Health and education are improving everywhere in the world. But the gap between countries\u2019 progress can be enormous. Our foundation\u2019s 2019 Goalkeepers report examines two of the biggest factors responsible for this inequality: https://t.co/TQjcnNbu2y https://t.co/FFIkp6Crzf The Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award is a well-deserved recognition of @gavi's life-saving work. Congratulations to all of the winners: https://t.co/Hvpw43o3jb Congratulations @BradSmi and @CarolAnnBrowne! Your insights have never been more relevant, and I am glad others will have the chance to benefit from them too. https://t.co/zDBkZk5YnB Today, it\u2019s difficult for researchers to diagnose #Alzheimers patients early enough to intervene. A reliable, easy and accurate diagnostic would be a game changer, and artificial intelligence could be the answer. https://t.co/M0FxOmUAX2 Here\u2019s a remarkable statistic: Nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme poverty today than in 1990.  But over 700 million still live on less than $2 a day. Six of them share their stories, their challenges, and their dreams for better lives. https://t.co/8zjsa5RiP7 The fact that a quarter of the kids born on the planet don\u2019t get the right food to develop is a mind-blowing tragedy. \n\nOur growing understanding of the microbiome will make this problem #solvable: https://t.co/IUI8I6EKxi https://t.co/fIf97bjwqL Climate change is one of the toughest challenges facing the world. But don\u2019t despair\u2026\n\nScientists and entrepreneurs are working on some innovative solutions. Here are four that I\u2019m excited about: https://t.co/WKwW0PccbI https://t.co/KEdegq2V0A Manufacturing steel is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Boston Metal is working to change this, and I\u2019m excited about their approach: https://t.co/3xp7NCHPio https://t.co/RPX6TEy3J2 Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. To #EndTB, we need to continue to develop safer and simpler solutions. The FDA\u2019s approval of a new treatment is a promising step in the right direction. https://t.co/dJQapVKgjW Whenever I hear an idea for what we can do to keep global warming in check, I always ask this question: \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for steel?\u201d \n\nI know it sounds like an odd thing to say, but it opens the door to a very important subject. https://t.co/Oo20WYmkAZ Germany, Italy, and the European Commission have demonstrated great leadership with their commitments to the @GlobalFund. Thank you @BMZ_Bund, @GiuseppeConteIT and @EU_Commission. Your pledges will help protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable from #AIDS, #TB, and #malaria. https://t.co/gfu5ovysf2 When I think about the world I want for my children, I know that #EqualityCantWait. When women and men can reach their full potential, everyone benefits: https://t.co/Yo2Ru84nBx Canada\u2019s $930 million commitment to the @GlobalFund is a big step towards saving millions of lives. Their pledge, and the commitments of other countries, are helping to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. https://t.co/wo4aKpQQ72 If we want to give our kids the best chance possible to succeed after high school, we need more teachers like @_MrHand: https://t.co/GxtYKlRH0u https://t.co/vqEtVG8XJF Today marks three years since Nigeria's last wild poliovirus case. This progress wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the bravery of the young women who volunteer as polio vaccinators. https://t.co/Nmn2PoN5dv Tomorrow is #WorldMosquitoDay, when we recognize all of our partners and grantees who are fighting against the world\u2019s deadliest animal and the diseases it spreads: https://t.co/RlZ2PlXt7V https://t.co/aIj2I5V16h I never really learned how to cook. I\u2019m finally learning my way around the kitchen, though, thanks to Robert Hand: https://t.co/AJdkDB7fzE https://t.co/g3pQw4fxpZ Four billion people are at risk from mosquito-borne diseases. We can get that number down to zero if we invest in new tools \u2014 like a set of techniques for genetically modifying mosquitoes \u2014 to complement the ones we already have. https://t.co/YSemQDFsw6 I learned a lot from Washington State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand about creating a classroom where kids want to be (and he taught me how to make BBQ chicken). https://t.co/V1XHZDy4GG Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose, and we were thrilled to learn that @WKamauBell is, too. Today, when you support teachers as they prepare to go back to school, your donation will get a 50% boost from our foundation: https://t.co/Klc2UIOcnw https://t.co/fHxSjoiFPl When teachers have the right tools, there\u2019s no telling where it will take them. Today, when you give to @DonorsChoose, @gatesfoundation will boost your donation by 50%. I hope you\u2019ll join us in supporting teachers. https://t.co/v8oWcwGhYF Being poor isn\u2019t cheap. It\u2019s hundreds of times more expensive to use charging stations than it is to charge a phone at home. That\u2019s just one of the hidden costs of unreliable electricity: https://t.co/1RTxaL1chd https://t.co/ymKCJo83em Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book. Here are some of the best ones I\u2019ve read so far this year: https://t.co/Q9RFZW6uid #BookLoversDay https://t.co/wwg8lsG3jI There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can: https://t.co/33sGjLspfT https://t.co/NRjXc2HReH Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don\u2019t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day. https://t.co/4jg2JC7EVQ Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn\u2019t rest until every child was reached. I can\u2019t wait to see what India achieves next. https://t.co/p5G2WuwPZb What if we really are all in this together? In this fascinating book, @NAChristakis explains why and how humans evolved to work together: https://t.co/SkaMiLYjkn https://t.co/l8gzfoWYCu 10 breakthrough technologies that could help us feed the world and fight climate change at the same time. https://t.co/u8zStX4iwQ It's hard to overstate how important finding a better diagnostic is for fighting #Alzheimers. That\u2019s why I\u2019m investing in new ideas for easier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease. https://t.co/WM9phNmyJo If you read one article about climate change this week, check out this one from @voxdotcom. Government support for energy R&amp;D is one of the best opportunities to fight climate change. https://t.co/fke57WYxM3 Are our similarities powerful enough to overcome our differences? \u201cBlueprint\u201d is an optimistic (and terrific) book that explores why humans have evolved to work together and cooperate. https://t.co/mQz07WvFgm I usually wait until the end of the year to share good news that you might have missed, but I couldn\u2019t resist sharing this list from @PositiveNewsUK (check out #14!). Which story has inspired you the most so far this year? https://t.co/2fSdE0BpPF Can you imagine an aircraft engine in your car? The @ARPAE Summit is one of the coolest places to learn about new energy tech. The @btenergy team came back with lots of new ideas and insights from this year\u2019s event. https://t.co/GZZKQ6w6dW The people who will suffer most from climate change are the ones least responsible for it. Here\u2019s how we can help them: https://t.co/S32e1ljJru https://t.co/18ueJU1kkX This is something I would have loved as a kid: @MicrosoftStore is hosting a series of free Camp Know Where events across the country. If your kids love science (and @Stranger_Things), I encourage you to check them out. https://t.co/hz7LJYIq2b What political and economic changes are needed to address climate change? If you\u2019re between 16 and 25 years old, share your idea with @TheEconomist. I look forward to reading the winning entry! #OpenFuture https://t.co/89cganUcdH Last year @GatesUS invested $92 million in networks of schools that are working together to improve student outcomes. Here\u2019s an update on the progress we\u2019ve made in the first year of the program \u2013 and what\u2019s next: https://t.co/pjkgxeZq3z https://t.co/6OabhP3Pd9 I recently wrote about how people with tech skills can find fascinating problems to work on in global health and development. I was excited to come across this @techreview article about African machine learning researchers who are already doing just that. https://t.co/3e1d2QvvH4 \u201cFathers who help unlock their daughter\u2019s potential, standing up for their rights and raising them to believe they have them, bring prosperity and happiness to their entire families.\u201d I recommend reading this essay from @ZiauddinY about @Malala. #MalalaDay https://t.co/SRqQjSa4vA Nearly one billion malaria cases have been prevented since 2000, but infection rates have plateaued or even increased in some areas. @axios explains how we can #StepUptheFight and end the disease for good. https://t.co/EKLQb8q1IH Can we feed 10 billion people? I\u2019m optimistic that we can if we invest in research that will help poor farmers adapt to climate change. https://t.co/KjKNQRMBJy Nuclear power is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world \u2014 but its growth is slowing down. This important @IEA report outlines how countries can support existing reactors and advance nuclear innovation. https://t.co/cS9cuHn1WA I wish I had understood much earlier in my career what true inequity looks like and how to fight it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m inspired by the story of William Wu, an engineer who started using his tech skills to fight inequity much sooner than I did: https://t.co/qEDOk3kVEo https://t.co/WDxHCur6Ki This is the teletype that brought Paul Allen and me together. And I\u2019m so glad that it did. Paul was one of the most thoughtful, brilliant, and curious people I\u2019ve ever met: https://t.co/CNw9gc5Xh7 https://t.co/pC9FIQ0kK5 More people are getting their electricity from renewable sources that ever before. Here\u2019s how we can build on the progress we\u2019ve made: https://t.co/ftMb24y6sd https://t.co/46kGyQP7EQ Today\u2019s commitment by @theresa_may to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB and malaria will help save millions of lives. @GlobalFund is one of the best investments the world can make in the years ahead: https://t.co/imFw4POQzI My friendship with Paul Allen changed my life. I loved sharing some of my favorite stories about him (and a few old photos!) at the Forbes Philanthropy Summit yesterday: https://t.co/3i6SFNg9q4 https://t.co/t2t7yTBVie Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery. I\u2019m excited that more inventors and investors are being attracted to the quest to build a better one. https://t.co/KAyNoiaXzr It\u2019s great to see such early support from Japan in re-committing to the @GlobalFund. The support of @AbeShinzo and the Japanese people will help the world #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. https://t.co/0oitm7xmA6 I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019re making toward understanding Alzheimer\u2019s. For the first time, @MIT researchers have completed an analysis of the genes that are expressed in individual brain cells of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. https://t.co/lluUJ0oC9u I love talking about toilets. @NatGeo recently wrote about two that I think could change the world.\nhttps://t.co/2Q521aLrDK I\u2019m excited to see such incredible leadership from @EmmanuelMacron and the people of France towards @GlobalFund. If more countries #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria, we can save 16 million lives. https://t.co/n0Wdr5ScCy I learned what\u2019s possible in agriculture from studying a remarkable scientist named Norman Borlaug. If you\u2019re curious about Borlaug and his breakthroughs, I recommend this article and a book called \u201cThe Man Who Fed the World.\u201d https://t.co/GZrs6iKxMX If you have the willingness to learn about a problem and the talent to help solve it, you can make a remarkable difference in the world. Just ask former NASA engineer William Wu: https://t.co/YDvisdSjki https://t.co/qB3qAQCrzR I encourage software developers, inventors, and scientists to consider how they can use their skills to fight inequity. https://t.co/bedv0SXjgs When @goodreads asked me to share my top summer reading recommendations, it was hard to narrow down the list. https://t.co/SlVDDIDnd7 Fighting disease is like fighting fire. It\u2019s not enough to put out most of it \u2014 you have to get it all. @Rotary\u2019s generous pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will help us extinguish this terrible disease for good. https://t.co/OHdVufsVrF The fight against malaria is one of the greatest success stories in global health \u2014 but progress has slowed in recent years. To regain momentum, we must work together to combat drug and insecticide resistance. https://t.co/2vw0LMzEuX I was moved by this story: Bob\u2019s daughter has Down syndrome, which puts her at a higher risk for dementia. Motivated by her condition and his love of science, he volunteered for an #Alzheimers clinical trial. https://t.co/tfQScwYo2J Our foundation\u2019s Day of Caring is one of my dad\u2019s favorite days of the year. I know he can\u2019t wait to hear what our employees learn from our partners this year. https://t.co/D2DNr3xCgE I\u2019m always amazed by the disconnect between what we see in the news and the reality of the world around us. As my late friend Hans Rosling would say, we must fight the fear instinct that distorts our perspective: https://t.co/uQRofM4q2u https://t.co/SzXDFr4clj Thank you for being a friend, Warren: https://t.co/4hhwUvkGox #BestFriendsDay https://t.co/1hmF1WE5gC I\u2019m thrilled about the elimination of malaria from Algeria and Argentina.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools like blood tests. https://t.co/pXuIUiIY4I I recently sat down with one of my favorite authors, Jared Diamond. His perspective on political polarization really caught my attention: https://t.co/cfPHMmYgcw https://t.co/F88NEAzZLp Breakthrough Energy Ventures \u2013 Europe will be a catalyst for innovative solutions to fight climate change. We have the resources to make a meaningful difference and the flexibility to move quickly. That\u2019s a rare and powerful combination. https://t.co/K4j7ggRzI4 We need the collective effort of governments, individuals, and the private sector to tackle climate change. I\u2019m excited about Canada\u2019s new partnership with @btenergy. #CEMMI2019 https://t.co/adQcnEpvxV I can\u2019t recommend these books highly enough: https://t.co/h9J71vWAcz https://t.co/3gOdcA4OaX Last year I recommended \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which is about the rise and fall of Theranos. This year I\u2019m recommending \u201cNine Pints,\u201d another book about blood that you won\u2019t want to put down. https://t.co/AcnsyCT9TR Congratulations @NarendraModi on a remarkable win in #IndianElections2019. Your continued commitment to improve health, nutrition, and development will significantly improve lives of many. @BJP4India I\u2019m a big fan of everything Jared Diamond has written, and his latest book, \u201cUpheaval,\u201d is no exception.

Our foundation is launching a new commission to find out: https://t.co/382oqYQ161 https://t.co/i1JXF0xTzU A college degree is the surest path to a healthy, rewarding life and career. But which degrees and programs provide the greatest value to students? Our foundation CEO @SueDHellmann is co-chairing a new commission to get that data into the hands of more families. https://t.co/0lszyYXPtH Everyone at the @gatesfoundation looks forward to days when our trustee Warren is on campus. @melindagates and I couldn\u2019t ask for a better champion for our employees, partners, and grantees. https://t.co/t7vlrjNR6s It is surprisingly hard to store renewable energy. Here are three startups I\u2019m excited about that are tackling this challenge: https://t.co/ilUAEa5TVJ https://t.co/PH0bNzRSJ2 It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by climate change and what to do about it.

Join the fight against preventable maternal deaths so that no child grows up without a mother. https://t.co/8MaSCBW012 All my life I\u2019ve been surrounded by remarkable women. And I was moved when Melinda decided to write about two of them \u2014 my mother and my grandmother \u2014 in her new book, The #MomentofLift. Happy #MotherDay to all the amazing mothers out there! https://t.co/syfEgdIz2N This fascinating #dataviz looks at how the global population pyramid is changing. With the right investments in health and education, young people at the bottom of the pyramid will drive tremendous growth and innovation. https://t.co/uvx1gFL7pu I was touched when Melinda asked me to introduce her at her #MomentofLift book tour stop in Seattle tonight. I wanted to do right by her but wasn\u2019t sure what the best approach was -- so I turned to someone with some expertise in this area\u2026 https://t.co/AYKp6MPC6E 2018 National Teacher of the Year @MandyRheaWrites told me about the remarkable resilience of her students.

We have them right here on earth. There\u2019s an epic scene at the end where Spock has to figure out which one is the impostor. https://t.co/yOSI4WyneG As a teenager, I remember watching an episode of the original Star Trek where the bad guy is a shapeshifter who turns himself into a second Captain Kirk. When I was younger, I loved science fiction. The author I read the most was Robert Heinlein (\u201cThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\u201d was a favorite).

But we never could have imagined how much fun we would have along the way. https://t.co/YZ3l4z94ao Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings is one of the five biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. I love that architects are looking to nature to find solutions. https://t.co/VXVuuCtOVY Most Americans want to know if they will get Alzheimer\u2019s as early as possible. That\u2019s an important insight for scientists as they work to improve diagnostic tools. https://t.co/Iz4ZBK4MZu Thanks to major breakthroughs over the last several years, we\u2019re closer than ever to having a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use way to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s. https://t.co/Ba7l79tPMR This surprised me: there\u2019s more carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined. Here\u2019s what that means for how we fight climate change: https://t.co/i1vPN7G3Sn https://t.co/iDv16zaMh1 Pivot Bio has developed an alternative to synthetic fertilizer that could help transform farming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: https://t.co/3keIlFe2MR https://t.co/iAdaBmKFVI I\u2019m thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry. Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. It\u2019s ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that\u2019s available 24 hours a day. To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it\u2014agriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildings\u2014by investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables. Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can\u2019t overstate how important this is. https://t.co/tRovGTm2sg RT @gatesfoundation: We\u2019re celebrating the anniversary of an incredible public health achievement - 5 years since the entire South-East Asi\u2026 We need to reach zero net emissions from every sector of the economy including agriculture (which, along with forestry, and land use, is responsible for almost as much greenhouse gas emissions as electricity). https://t.co/Sioivi1R9L Most discussions about fighting climate change focus on electricity and the need for renewable energy. De-carbonizing the way we generate electricity would be a huge step, but it won\u2019t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. https://t.co/C4oCIz6iXg Five years ago, India was declared poliofree. Whenever someone asks me how they did it, I tell them about one of the country\u2019s lowest castes: the Musahar. https://t.co/X6AZTigffl https://t.co/I2Ija5AyKY I\u2019m inspired by Azim Premji\u2019s continued commitment to philanthropy.

This is a great conversation between @robotsmarts and @timnitGebru on the importance of representation and female leadership in tech. https://t.co/21uMzF5Ofk If you want to discover what makes a school great, there\u2019s no substitute for spending time in the classroom. I learned a lot from the students and teachers at this Chicago school: https://t.co/hN6zJEnjQW https://t.co/pL5cHJCejq Medical advances should be available to everyone who needs them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about an inexpensive blood test that could help doctors predict if a baby will be born prematurely. This information would undoubtedly save lives. https://t.co/GsCYZU7gqs It\u2019s great to see leaders in Washington talking about accelerating energy innovation to fight climate change. This op-ed from @lisamurkowski and @Sen_JoeManchin is worth reading. https://t.co/Z45BIXBLVq I was lucky to be a young person when the digital revolution was just getting under way, and my Microsoft colleagues and I had the chance to help shape it.

As Yusef \u2014 a senior at North-Grand High School in Chicago \u2014 told me, he is \u201cseeing himself clearly\u201d in ways he couldn\u2019t before thanks to better data about his progress: https://t.co/zlGlEZPZPE https://t.co/yeKQdwXL9T When I visited Ethiopia last month, I was impressed by the government\u2019s commitment to gender equality. Ethiopian President @SahleWorkZewde explains why lifting up women benefits everyone. https://t.co/XCc6IXqRa2 Melinda\u2019s work on behalf of women and girls inspires me every day. I love this video she made for #IWD2019 https://t.co/1CeWYGPTAv Tomorrow is #IWD2019 \u2014 a day when we celebrate the progress made by and for women. To celebrate, @melindagates is sharing a chapter from her new book, \u201cThe Moment of Lift,\u201d about the lessons she\u2019s learned from women around the world. https://t.co/im5O3CRRaQ I recently visited a high school that has gone from one of Chicago\u2019s worst to one of its best: https://t.co/1GaU7pLcSs https://t.co/wHMDnmVJjF By embracing data, research, and community, schools have an opportunity to help students succeed in high school, college, and beyond. https://t.co/Yzcgxi47S3 Congrats on your 100th title @rogerfederer!

In the meantime, Melinda and I are working on our next Annual Letter, which we\u2019re going to send out in February. Although I\u2019ve never been one for New Year\u2019s resolutions, I\u2019m making one for 2019: I\u2019m committing to learn and think more about the balance between privacy and security, as well as the use of technology in education. Gene editing might be the most important public debate we\u2019re not having right now. Read up on it whenever you have a chance. Even better, read @DrSidMukherjee\u2019s \u201cThe Gene.\u201d https://t.co/4qM8faMGkp The good news is that there has been progress toward a vaccine that would protect you from every possible strain of the flu. But the world still needs to develop a global system for responding to epidemics. I had hoped that hitting the 100th anniversary of the Spanish flu would spark a lot of discussion about whether we\u2019re ready for the next global epidemic. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t, and we still are not ready. Some people think we have all the clean-energy sources we need to stop climate change. But we don\u2019t. As I wrote earlier this year, the world needs to be working on lots of solutions to stop climate change. https://t.co/I2wylMHEJE This year @btenergy, the clean-energy investment fund I\u2019m involved with, announced the first companies we\u2019re putting money into. Almost a decade ago, I predicted that the world would soon be polio free. But we had more polio cases in 2018 than in 2017. Even so, I remain optimistic that we could eradicate polio soon. Just over a year ago, I made my first investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. I\u2019m hopeful that we can make a lot of progress in the coming years. 1/ What a year. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re taking stock of your work and your life, and wondering where all the time went.

Here\u2019s my review: https://t.co/7VU7i8wvPA The portion of the global economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model just keeps getting larger. But the rules that govern the economy haven\u2019t kept up. This is one of the biggest trends in the global economy that isn\u2019t getting enough attention. Unlike the goods that powered our economy in the past, software is an intangible asset -- \u201csomething you can\u2019t touch.\u201d And it\u2019s not the only example: data, insurance, e-books, even movies work in similar ways. But software doesn\u2019t work like this. Microsoft might spend a lot of money to develop the first unit of a new program, but every unit after that is virtually free to produce. This chart assumes that the total cost of production increases as supply increases. When a car company makes a new vehicle, the 10th car costs the same to manufacture as the 1000th. At the time I was in college, this was basically how the global economy worked... https://t.co/2polaSbsXY My friend @PaulGAllen's @LivingComputers Museum &amp; Lab is a great place to learn about the tech revolution and what will come next.

I think innovation\u2014and the urgency brought on by climate change\u2014will speed up the process when it comes to clean energy. Smil is absolutely right that the transition to clean energy will not happen overnight. Here is a chart showing that energy transitions can take many decades. https://t.co/2vV4tB2E9Z Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite authors. I\u2019ve read nearly all of his 37 books.

But there were heroes 1,000 years ago, and life was awful. Modernity\u2014being able to flush the toilet and turn on the lights\u2014is a miracle of systems plus heroes. https://t.co/c92VUmlbjP \u201cThings can be both better and bad.\u201d This is the heart of our foundation\u2019s work. It\u2019s bad that 5 million children die every year\u2014but it\u2019s better than it was, which is why I think it can keep improving. https://t.co/hcYm3u0kX1 \u201cFactfulness,\u201d by the late Hans Rosling, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a long time.

We need lots of innovation to get there, and @ARPAE is leading the way: https://t.co/thKFCIsq6o #ARPAE18 I feel lucky to have known Stephen Hawking. His work is an inspiring reminder of what human minds are capable of. I often meet with educators who have creative ideas about how to make school systems work for every child.

This is a great conversation with @EasterbrookG about his new book, \u201cIt\u2019s Better Than It Looks.\u201d https://t.co/ou4UdXuqnU The evidence is clear: if you want to empower women and girls, give them the power to decide what to do with their own money. #IWD2018 https://t.co/YO5gJ6f7Zl Tomorrow is #IWD2018 \u2014 a day when the world celebrates the progress made by and for women.
