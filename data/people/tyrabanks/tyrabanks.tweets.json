Beauty is in the self-confidence you project, and the ownership of who YOU are! @LenaWaithe, I see you and applaud that fierce hairstyle you got goin\u2019 on! https://t.co/lGtOMPua7Y Iconic. Beyond any level of fierce. The way she brought Obama to tears, tossed her fur coat to the ground, and effortlessly hit every single note with so much passion and love for the sound. https://t.co/nncoLpaoIq Aretha the Queen. Aretha Franklin epitomized that fierce black woman soul with just enough touch of pain in her vibrato, to make every human bow down to those precious vocals that only she could produce. May the heavens above shout with eternal pride, R-E-S-P-E-C-T! I wonder what age my son will be when me kissing his lil\u2019 cute feet will stop.

Because they are exactly that...personal. I see so many others sharing SO MUCH and often ask myself, \u201cShould I?\u201d But in the end, I just don\u2019t. I hate it that I feel guilty when enjoying a rare, beautiful moment without pulling out my damn phone, snapping pic and sharing it. Dearest Avocado,\n\nPlease oh please be green inside and clear of anything that makes me scrape away unsightly parts of your insides. You all are so creative in so many ways! I love your creations and fun fan art.
