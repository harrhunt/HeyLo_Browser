My point from the start! Thanks! @FABlichert Yes @FABlichert And that\u2019s bad. @FABlichert On Rotten Tomatoes and the other widely used review databases, yeah. And it happens all the time. This shining review isn\u2019t on there. A good one is. @FABlichert It removes context. It removes the idea that sometimes critics get it wrong because it retroactively let\u2019s them get it right without ever making it clear that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. @chancetherapper Saw that shit in theaters. @BlaireBitchproj @Showtime @SHOBlackMonday Thank you! #BlackMonday is on Showtime tonight.

This image is not actually from #PineappleExpress, but is from a skit we shot for the Oscars that year, which was filmed by Spielberg\u2019s DP, Janusz Kaminski. https://t.co/GSDH7QTGix Kanye came to the premiere of #PineappleExpress. https://t.co/VpOMXHoiJI In #PineappleExpress, Saul calls his shit weed \u201cSnicklefritz\u201d because it\u2019s what our practical FX supervisor would call his second in command when he didn\u2019t like what he was doing and we thought it was hilarious. Of all the weird references in #PineappleExpress, my favorite is to the fact that Matheson is wearing \u201cBritish Knights\u201d, because when I was a kid I wore the fuck out of my BK\u2019s. The song Paper Planes by MIA does not actually appear in the movie #PineappleExpress, just the trailer. We DID have a smoking billboard for #PineappleExpress that got shut down by the fire department because people keep thinking it was on fire. https://t.co/UslrDgNyuN Huey Lewis and the News recorded an original theme song for #PineappleExpress. We were inspired by our favorite 80s movies that had rock songs with their titles. Here he is performing it on Kimmel: https://t.co/nXVbuiW9z0 via @YouTube In #PineappleExpress, originally, Red killed Matheson with a Ford Fiesta, but Ford didn\u2019t want their car involved in a movie murder so we had to change it to a Daewoo Lanos, which is ultimately much funnier I think. RT @eliistender10: I made #Lego #PineappleExpress @LEGO_Group @Sethrogen https://t.co/abNHe0F2rg @Pattiwithaneye Haha. That\u2019s true. I did my 99% of my own stunts in #PineappleExpress, (which might explain all the injuries) including this one: https://t.co/DrV9jF1wIS While we were filming the scene where Red is taped to the chair in #PineappleExpress, Danny had to actually be taped in the chair all day and we couldn\u2019t let him out because it took too long to put him back. https://t.co/vBmmcRTuiL @RoyalCaribbean @younghollywood All in good fun. In #PineappleExpress, Red was originally supposed to die the first time he was shot when he was tied up in his apartment, but we thought Danny Mcbride was so funny that we just kept bringing him back to life. The shots of the dick drawings on the principals desk in Superbad was actually filmed on the set of #PineappleExpress in the woods while we were shooting Dale and Saul destroying their cell phones. We wrote #PineappleExpress express for me to play Saul and Franco to play Dale. James wanted to switch roles, and I didn\u2019t care that much, so we did. In #PineappleExpress, Red refers to his ex wife having gotten out of jail recently. There\u2019s a pic of Red and his ex wife, who was played by Stormy Daniels. The reason Saul wears a headband in #PineappleExpress is the result of another injury. There\u2019s a shot (that\u2019s in the movie) when we are running through the woods, Franco hits his head on a tree. He actually hit his head on a screw that was holding a pad in place and got stitches. Throughout the fight scene in Red\u2019s house in #PineappleExpress, I broke my finger and Danny McBride got his head cracked open when Franco hit him with the bong. There was NO strain of weed called #PineappleExpress when we made the movie. We said \u201cif one day, people are out there selling weed called Pineapple Express, it worked\u201d. The name #PineappleExpress was around for years before the movie. It\u2019s a Hawaiian weather system that sometimes hits the Pacific Northwest, which is where we\u2019re from. Evan heard the name and said \u201cthat would be a great name for a movie.\u201d  Years later we found a perfect fit. In #PineappleExpress, me and my co-writer Evan had to roll all the cross joints needed to film (about 100) ourselves because nobody else on the crew could roll them properly. #PineappleExpress came out ten years ago today.  Here\u2019s some fun facts about the movie! https://t.co/8dMjT2YKyE New #Preacher tonight on AMC. This show is wonderful and crazy. Please watch if you like those things.

Sure. @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible. I just don\u2019t understand how I would do it, so I\u2019m really trying to understand your strategy. Seriously, how do you envision the Disney meeting happening? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I honestly don\u2019t understand how you envision the conversation with Disney playing out. I really want to understand this. How would it go in an ideal world? @Pariah1974 @RMTheLastJedi Yo I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the strategy. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi They why didn\u2019t they pay off the critics more for Solo? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think you understand the intricacies of the legality concerning intellectual properties. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi So, roughly, would you say it\u2019s done pretty much the amount of times you don\u2019t agree with the critical consensus? @yttttttt46 @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi Yeah. But you can\u2019t get 200 million without those things. You need those things to get money, from my understanding of the process. @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi But they can\u2019t call it Star was the last Jedi. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi Why don\u2019t all studios do it? This makes no sense at all. According to this logic there would be no expensive movies with bad reviews. @BubbaBumpass @GarethKowalski @RMTheLastJedi And DC just didn\u2019t think of trying that? Or just once with WW but then they bailed on the strategy for JL? This is a funny theory. @GarethKowalski @RMTheLastJedi Hahah. That\u2019s hilarious. @aragonxxc @RMTheLastJedi It is? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi What\u2019s the point? @RMTheLastJedi Pandering to whom? I\u2019m confused by why you think critics would pretend to like a movie? Why would that benefit them? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I have. @MMaestracci @coraliefargeat Tu es Seth Rogen. @NyashaJunior @BuzzFeedNews You\u2019re telling me. @realAmer_Indian @RMTheLastJedi Yo please explain! I honestly want to understand this strategy. Maybe I\u2019ll try something like this if it\u2019s a good one! @RMTheLastJedi I reread your other tweet. So from what I gather you don\u2019t have investors, so Disney would just be entrusting you with the IP in the hopes you do it justice and are able  to pay for it. Is that the plan? I\u2019m so curious how this is supposed to work. @adamctierney @RMTheLastJedi Yeah that\u2019s a good point. Any plans for this remake guy? @RMTheLastJedi So do you already have investors? Like, you already got people to invest money with the HOPES that Disney will let you make this, which there is no reason or historical precedent for? @RobJustJokin I\u2019m in all those movies. @RMTheLastJedi How did you get investors without a script or stars or director or legal ability to make this movie? Those have been important elements in the past. @RMTheLastJedi Ok. Is someone actually investing money in this? @RMTheLastJedi Yo I\u2019m very confused as to what your goal is here. You literally want to spend 200 million dollars remaking the last Jedi? And someone is giving you that money? I don\u2019t get it. @AndyRichter This tweet isn\u2019t getting the credit it deserves.

It was something that came up. @PosterSpy @AMCtvUK @nickybarkla @_derekwilson @dominiccoop @IanColletti @PrintedinBlood @Pixalry @WeGeekGirls @GeekyNerfherder @JemalPolson This is dope @EmperorrKuzco I wasn't thrilled either. @EricVespe It's also based on an outrageously famous existing property. @mrDaveKrumholtz @AlecBaldwin Why do you care if one of his accounted blocked you when this other one didn't? @mrDaveKrumholtz @AlecBaldwin He can't see these tweets, Dave. @NKDev22 The Disaster Artist. You can bid on a signed Pineapple Express script and much more from people more famous than me! It helps wounded veterans! Thank you! https://t.co/zhSVpiHNkO @jaketapper No prob man. @MattMira The Fiero plays an integral role in the show. Here's a video about the making of our new show #FutureMan!

Both are not great ways of engaging in my opinion. @ggreenwald @dannyboi965 But in movies they learned that for less money, you can get more if you influence social media. @ggreenwald @dannyboi965 I know from movies it's not about spending. It's about how you spend. And the movie (or person) itself is often (not always) the key factor. @kthalps @ggreenwald I just think that sometimes the \"if you're gonna be mad at THAT, then it's hypocritical to not be mad at THIS\" is sometimes not productive. @ggreenwald @dannyboi965 And again, I'm not looking to win this discussion. I'm just trying to get insight. @ggreenwald @dannyboi965 Not disagreeing with you there. @ggreenwald And I've watched this talk already. @ggreenwald I agree with all that. I thought he would win way before the election. I ALSO think Russia influenced people and votes. @ggreenwald I get NO comfort from thinking Russia influenced our election. Believe me. @ggreenwald I know it's impossible to prove. That's why it's a weird position for you to take. You're saying that it didn't effect things. @ggreenwald I'm not comparing it to anything. I'm just confused how you can argue it didn't effect anything. There's no evidence proving it didn't. @ggreenwald So you think that evidence shows that propaganda is not effective? And it doesn't change people's views? @ggreenwald I'm not arguing that. I'm just curious if you think that propaganda just doesn't work? It reached over 100 mil Americans. @ggreenwald I'm genuinely curious: do you not think that propaganda has an impact on people's thinking and actions? @AlyseWhitney @ilazer @dopequeenpheebs Shit I need that shirt. @JohnMayer That's contractual Here's an article I wrote about Franco because they asked me to and I like him a lot so I said yes. https://t.co/TbMfFhvrlF RT @billyeichner: Timon and Pumbaa 2019. #TheLionKing #BillyontheStreet #tbt \ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc51 https://t.co/AlZiNPT1bf Here's a new trailer for The Disaster Artist!
