He didn't make the decision to exonerate Trump last week; he made it 9 months ago. Democrats need to stop having faith in \"good\" Republicans saving them. It didn't come from Comey, or Mueller, or Rosenstein, and it won't come from Kasich or Romney or William Weld or anyone else. You're going to have to do it yourself. As crooked as Barr is starting to look, the difference in reaction to this report finally coming out is profound: we accept, discuss legal alternatives,etc. If the report said guilty, they would have gone apeshit, accepted nothing and threatened violence.

Even if there's no Russian collusion (there is), or other criminality (there is)..

That was Alec Baldwin, right? Not a single question about climate change in all 3 debates. Sad. No, really - sad. Brilliant closing, Don: \"vote for her and you get 4 more years of Obama\" - a president with a 55% approval rating. This was by far Hillary's best debate, bravo. But that jacket makes me want to ask her to cut me a slab of prime rib. Until a month ago, Trump thought Aleppo was Omarosa's brother. #Debatenight I'm trying to remember, when we invaded Iraq in 2003, yes of course it was all Hillary's doing, but wasn't there someone else...Bush maybe? I never realized Hillary was the emperor of the world for the last 30 years, solely responsible for every bad thing that ever happened. Hmm. Oh for fuck sake, if Trump was any more of a pussy he'd have to grab himself. #Debatenight When will Trump realize that saying \"Wrong!\" makes him look like a #WhinyLittleBitch ? Trump: I didn't even apologize to my wife! I wrote her a check, like always. Right, the 73 yr old woman he groped on a plane wants \"fame\" - hoping to parlay this into a movie career and start dating James Franco. Man, Hillary's debate prep was worth every minute, his predictable insults are getting overhead slammed. Also, Cubs up by 4. Hey, Hillary, what about Trump's excellent plan to help small business by taking women furniture shopping? Trump talking about creating millions of new jobs - Billy Bush at home saying, \"Well you lost me mine!\" Hillary looks like a president. Like a president dealing with an idiot at a town hall. #Debatenight This got nasty fast. But remember, when he goes low, I get high. #Debatenight We know he's a five year old, but does he really have to say \"You're the puppet!\" \"No, you are!\" And this guy is still in the race? Jesus. Is \"bigly\" a word? No, its not. That should be disqualifying itself! Hillary doesn't want to put immigrants on buses, where they'll just be egged on by Billy Bush. #debatenight Also, the sniffling kicks in when he starts talking about drugs. Sad. So far, she is killing him, and he sounds like he knows he's toast. Also sounds like he's about 2 cigars away from an electrolarynx Trump on fetuses: In 20 years, they'll be dating me! Don't forget \"Go to Hillary Clinton dot com\" is code for \"He's a lying sack of shit\" Telling that right off the bat, Trump makes the Supreme Court question about HIM! As always, he was insulted!Thats all that matters, people! They're letting Hillary talk - its rigged!! Debate prediction: Closest we get to talk of climate change tonight is when Trump mentions his daughter keeps getting hotter.

OK, I don't know how Bill Cosby got his knock-out drugs into their green room drinks, but this snooze fest is boring, like Dem Debate boring Btw, \"Waste, Fraud and Abuse\" was the curriculum at Trump University. Huh, new tactic here for Republicans - actually paying attention to facts? What the hell happened tonight? I'm bored. Who's dick is bigger?? Had to run out for a sec - do they still hate Mexicans? Ben Carson endorsing Trump, wow. And Trump brags, of course: \"so honored to be endorsed by the guy I called a child molester\" Also, not surprised Goofy endorsed Trump Trump: \"Only I can stop me from fucking America's workers!\" Not fair to ask Marco about Disney World! They know he's not tall enough to get on the rides! Trump very \"low energy\" so far. No joy in it for him unless another of the monkeys is hurling poop his way. Come on, get to the pissing contest. Although, after the last debate, that could literally come true Kasich kicks off Republican debate with sanity and hope - that's like kicking off an orgy with a bible verse OK,gonna try to watch with you; I pre-apologize for that moment when I just can't take these insufferable assholes 1 more minute.

On so many issues, you can only get @GOP support if it touched one of their own: #ClimateChange https://t.co/7NOYpcvWEY Any Republican who watched that debate and thinks they can remain in the Very Serious Person's Club without quitting the party..well,U can't is it me, or do Trump/Cruz/Rubio go on and on screaming their bullshit, they go to Kasich, he says 3 words: DING! Times up, wrong party. Not that it hasn't been all along, but now its just sad. I feel like the Indian in the old PSA with the tear rolling down his cheek. Dr. Ben Carson: no wins, 2nds, 3rds or even 4ths. Dr. Ben, maybe you shld think about...Dr. Ben? Dr. BEN!! All right, I'll come back later. So far Trump is proving something I've always maintained about American politics: You throw your lot in with the Klan, you can win the South Well if this night doesnt put an end to racism and childfucking, i dont know what will!! Yes! Leo won! Finally, some light in this man's life! This is so exciting: is it the one i never heard of or the one i didnt see?

Its that time in the debate where my mind is drifting Wait,did Ben Carson just actually admit he fell asleep? Kasich looks like the college professor where you drop the class after the first day Well, Trump is right about one thing: the world is laughing at us. OK guys, we get it, Isis is bad, but first, America's greatest threat: Mexican cleaning ladies! Ben Carson got in! Yeah! Now, back to looking like he's ignoring a rape on the subway...

His stock has fallen so fast Oil feels bad for him. Christie: Just keep the bad people out. Shit, why didn't we think of that? Just keep out the ones who self-identify as bad! Duh! So we're not the world's policeman, but we'll bomb and torture anyone anywhere for any reason? Should THEY be calling a policeman? of all the issues they are infuriating about...lambasting Obama for not doing...exactly what he's already doing, always takes the cake And one more thing: Do you get to say \"New Yorkers are garbage people\" if you're a Cuban from Calgary? And by the way, what is a New York value? A studio apartment for $2,500 a month. Value - that's a steal! Cruz to New York: Drop dead. If we didn't have the stupid electoral college, they couldn't write off THIRTY EIGHT STATES! Of course Trump is for arming everyone, he's got the bulletproof hair! \"Isis does not get their guns from gun shows\". True - they get them from the U S military. How many humvees did they capture in Mosul? Yes, when Obama said Rednecks cling to their guns and their religion...way off on that one. Oh Jeb, does Fla. really get to weigh in on guns? The one with the law \"If you make me nervous, I get to shoot you?\" Well, that wasn't so bad. What, there's more? Shit. I'm playing Words with Friends with John Kasich right now! Christie: \"I vetoed a ban on guns that can shoot down airplanes and through the doors of squad cars.\" Applause. Wheres Isis when u need 'em? I've seen productions of Boys in the Band that weren't this bitchy. Man, for a Canadian, Cruz fights nasty like a...well, like an American! Trump to Cruz: \"I'm not bringing a suit, I promise\" - that's what he said to me before he sued me! The crows at the republican debate just booed the Wall St Journal. Welcome to the Bird Sanctuary Thank god, a commercial break. \"Back to more making you shit your pants, after this word from Depends!\" Saying we need to rebuild our military is like saying county fairs need more fried foods I like the audience shots - takes the myth that the Republicans are a bunch of angry old white people...and proves it Christie: \"If i'm president, Hillary won't get within ten miles of the white house\"- great, more bridge closures Love the way they now all say \"Sure, the millionaires are doing great...\" - and when I find the assholes who paved the way for that!... Haha, Cruz made sure he was first to say Obama's a pussy because our sailors got released, on a question about the economy. He's the worst!

Don't forget we're back January 15th! @HBO #RealTime https://t.co/jYF3A5CmKC Happy birthday, #TedCruz,  you amoral putz, who keeps going up in the race - that's the Republicans for ya, the shit rises to the top And some of these people - oy. Frank must be spinning. Is there such a thing as DISowning a song? Watchin Sinatra100: Do country singers need to wear a cowboy hat w/ a tuxedo? Ur Garth Brooks, ur..other country guy, we get it, ur rednecks Dr. Ben looked bad last night: Look everybody, I studied up, I know what a Shiite is now! And Trump didn't know what nuclear triad meant. Oy Now that 1st 96 hours of the debate r over, quick question:a president's 1st job - keeping the ppl safe?Cuz they've been kinda vague on that RT @rbpconcerts: Pre-sale tickets are on sale NOW to An Evening with Bill Maher live in Sacramento this Valentine's Day! Code: BILL4 https:\u2026 L A now? When are cops gonna get it: U can't just shoot people in the street! Folks have cameras now! Jeez, what were they doing BEFORE? Ted Cruz is like a \"Survivor\" winner: forms an alliance with Trump only to lull him into getting killed off. Never forget, #CruzIsTheWorst RT @rbpconcerts: Pre-sale tickets are on sale NOW to An Evening with @billmaher live at Marin Center on March 26th. Code: RBP https://t.co/\u2026 Oh I see, they believed the baby wld go to paradise too if they did the attack. Sure. C what we mean about bad ideas leading to bad actions? Steven Weinberg said that, and that's how you get ppl who \"always acted normal\" (don't they always?) dropping a baby off to go to a massacre \"W/ or w/out religion U wld have good ppl doing good things &amp; evil ppl doing evil thingsBut 4 good ppl to do evil things that take religion\" Stop comparing random shooters to Islamic terrorists. Apples &amp; Oranges. One is bent on acquiring WMD to set off in America. End. of. Story. I see the computer hackers Anonymous are going after Isis - if successful, it'd mean martyrs DO get screwed by virgins! Happy TG everybody! I don't want to say my turkey is big, but a Russian fighter jet just entered its airspace! Freed Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard called 'the Jewish James Bond' - I can see the movie: \"Tomorrow Never Dies, It Just Keeps Complaining\" Liberal Values vs. Islam: @HBO #RealTime https://t.co/LRJLBS2yhs #BenCarson is the black Sarah Palin. Says he loves the french, especially that pyramid in front of the Louvre where they keep their grain As someone with the credentials of always keeping it real about Islam, let me say Trump's idea about registering Muslims is outrageous. Republicans have Obama right where they want him on the Paris attacks: as usual, an abject failure to overreact on his part Feisty fun time with Colbert tonight - one more Real Time on Friday and then I 'm off till new years eve in hawaii! Gone fishin'! #ParisAttacks Lets make #TerrorismSociallyUnacceptable which means liberals standing firm for Liberal principles! Yeah, Trump talking about nukes, i gotta go or i won't sleep tonight. Peace out! OK...now we're getting to the foreign affairs part, which, if possible, they know even less about. I can feel me going for the remote... Biggest applause is to upbloat even more the military budget. Hard to say who's the bigger tools, the candidates or the audience. Jeb Bush: Should i even stick around or, maybe beat the traffic? Herman Cain was a joke for saying 9-9-9! Ben Carson is serious, cuz he says 10-10-10. Is there lead paint in those flag pins? #GOPDebate Hey moderators, stop asking how they'd pay for it! DIdn't you hear, My tax plan lets you eat whatever you want and lose weight! Cruz: \"There are more words in the IRS code than the Bible\". Yes, but none of them are in favor of slavery or ethnic cleansing. And \"Let's try the one thing in healthcare we've never tried - the free market!\" You see why i'm drunk now?! Carly: \"I have led innovative businesses!\" Into the ground. And then they fired me. I'm doing a shot every time Carly lies. I'm drunk. #GOPDebate Kasich and Bush, gotta give 'em credit on immigration, trying to start a \"Republicans who believe in Reality\" movement. Good luck with that. Trump's immigration plan is like a bar at closing time: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here! #GOPDebate Trump: \"We are a country of laws\" Thankfully, bankruptcy laws Ben Carson: Stop smearing me with these unfounded accusations that i'm not a murderous psychopath! Carly, how do you explain Dems creating more jobs? Carly: Let me tell you a story about some lady. #GOPDebate Have you noticed they always sit the three black people behind the moderators? I think this is Jeb Bush's fourth Do or Die moment. Let's just say he's not Doing. Kasich said \"thrice\" - is that too fancy a word? I think it might be! #NotaWelder btw, fact check: average wage for welder, 37k; philosopher professor, 89k. TongueStuckOutEmoji. This is boring. Let's get to the part where Ben Carson attacks his mom with a hammer. Marco really studied his flash cards for this one! More welders, less philosophers! Yeah, that's,um, vaguely anti people i think i hate! gotta give it to Trump, he doesn't pander: 'Minimum wage? Fuck you, get rich or die, next question.' My first question for the debaters: This is on Fox Business channel, is that NON-LIBERAL enough for your pussy asses? Is it me, or does Reince Priebus look like that guy at the funeral home who comes in with the casket catalogue? About to live tweet the Repub debate, and the big question, How long will i last before i say \"Fuck these assholes, i feel physically ill!\"? #GOPDebate https://t.co/NiXBwwo7CA Did Jeb Bush really answer the question \"Would U kill baby Hitler?\"? Yes, he did. Why do ppl get mad at me for saying its a stupid country? Headin out to Ames, Iowa for some quality time with vote-begging Repubs! Also standup tonight at C Y Stephens at Iowa State! Republican Neophyte #BenCarson: https://t.co/JNdb42nUZs Did Dr. Giggles really say the pyramids aren't pharoahs' tombs, they're Joseph's grain silos? Who's he appealing to, soccer mummies?

Christie just ate Bush's lunch! And probably others. Now this is the inning we have to get some runs!! When in doubt, shit on the federal gov't. Fantasy football? Fuck the federal gov't! Trump is right, Bush is low energy. He always looks like the guy who's in the car reading while his wife is in a store shopping. Debt relief? Fuck debt relief, we need long relief - get somebody up in the bullpen! The big takeaway so far from watching the debate between innings? Not. Missing. Anything. Way to score!!! No, not you Carson you crazy head case, Murphy!! oh my god did i just hear Ted Cruz say something awesome that i agree with? Yes. The media is even stupider than the pols. Who's on first? deGrom is mowing them down! And Kasich was pretty good mowing down Trump &amp; Carson on living in FantasyLand! Go Kasich! Wait, i mean Go Mets! The only way this debate is going to be survivable is if the Mets get out to a big lead. Then i don't care what Trump says. Like now. Oh lord,another debate with more STUPID QUESTIONS?! Asking \"What's your weakness?\" is an invitation to a humblebrag, fools! Back to the Mets You mean prophecies from 80s movies are NOT reliable?? Congratulations @Mets and one more series to go!

I think #BenCarson might have inhaled a little too much anesthesia 20 minutes on valet parkers without I D while flames from wildfires lick the walls of the Reagan library. HOW BOUT A CLIMATE QUESTION????? When does one of these assholes have the guts to call Reagan out for his amnesty for Mexicans? For the first time in this campaign, Trump is humbled (by Carly) and looked apologetic and not true to what he believes. Start of the end? Carly: I'd urge every American to watch these doctored, heavily edited, manipulated tapes and come to the false conclusion I have! How about asking the one woman on the stage about Planned Parenthood Quick question: When #TedCruz shaves in the morning, how does he avoid spitting in the mirror? #GOPDebate Bloodthirsty, factfree belligerence: Yayyy! Rand Paul's reasoned restraint: polite smattering. Dead Nixon just called Scott Walker: I want my lip sweat back! Carly explaining Republican diplomacy: I'm not talking to you! We insult you,and then you do what we say! Why is everyone overthinking this? When #BenCarson speaks, i keep waiting for one of those Lunesta butterflies to fly by \"I want to talk about serious, non-personal issues, but PizzaFace and Fatso here won't let me!\" Don't adjust your sets, Scott Walker's face really looks like that The conspiracy of delusion about how Obama wrecked America is astounding. Hello, unemployment is lower than Reagan ever had it! Two minutes in, and its kindergarden slams about who's ugly. Even professional wrestlers are like, Guys, c'mon...a little dignity. #ChrisChristie: Take the camera off me. American public: Good idea. To sum up opening statements: God bless America, too bad its such a shithole. #GOPDebate Jeb, lame opening. But, when he sees a plane inside a building he thinks of his brother, so he's a little off his game. #GOPDebate #BenCarson needs to chug a little red bull before the show. Nice gesture tho that he offered to separate Christie's conjoined chins Trump used to hang out with serious people like @LouFerrigno and @LaToyaJackson and now he has to share a stage with these losers. #Sad Must say, #ChrisChristie looks good tonight, he really - oh, wait, sorry, that's Air Force One 1st off, Air Force One in the background is confusing: CNN viewers are thinking, Wow, they found the missing plane!

Great pitch, Jeb: \"Elect me, and I'll make America like Florida\" Really?? The order came down from Roger Ailes: Destroy Trump!

Huckabee wants to fund social security on their backs? Could work, they're already on their backs Christie just broke the \"Whatever you do, keep pandering\" rule. He's toast. And he's fat, so make a toast joke, I'm getting tired. Get to China, so Trump can call them Motherfuckers! Ben Carson doubts HIllary will be the Dem nominee?? Ben, do you still have your brain-cutting tools? And a mirror? OK, lie down...#GOPDebate I love the ads! \"More of how to save America,but first another ad that takes gay-hating old ppl's $ to accuse Supreme Crt of being \"lawyers\" I knew Education would come up.
