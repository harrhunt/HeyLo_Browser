After more than 100 days, the Supreme Court still needs its 9th judge, but the Senate GOP refuses to do its job and consider Judge Garland. Congress is leaving a hefty to-do list undone. Health officials still need emergency funding to effectively protect Americans from Zika. Proud to sign laws to improve transparency and avert a crisis in Puerto Rico.

Let me know if you need any pointers. https://t.co/WullueHj28 The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities. What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives. We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment. Tomorrow, I'm taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives - protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. https://t.co/vNqXEhaC9M Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.

Today, we give thanks for all of our loved ones and the brave men and women in uniform who serve our country. Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do. Welcoming the world\u2019s vulnerable who seek the safety of America is not new to us. We've safely welcomed 3 million refugees since 1975. Here, our focus is giving safe haven to the most vulnerable Syrians \u2013 women, children, and survivors of torture. We will provide refuge to at least 10,000 refugees fleeing violence in Syria over the next year after they pass the highest security checks. We also win this fight with our values. America can ensure our own security while welcoming refugees desperately seeking safety from ISIL. Protecting the American people is my top priority. With our 65 global partners, we're leading the campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL. This is an American hero: Capt. Groberg put it all on the line for his team. On his worst day, he gave us his best. https://t.co/WdWAPswJpE Today, we honor the incredible men and women who have served our country. Their sacrifice and selflessness is second to none.

So I'm eager to hear from folks in Charleston today on actions we can take to put recovery within reach for anyone who needs it. Communities are showing that we should approach substance use disorders as an opportunity to intervene rather than a race to incarcerate. With no other disease do we expect people to wait until they're a danger to themselves or others to self-diagnose and seek treatment. 4 in 5 heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioids. Heroin-related deaths nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013. Sales of powerful painkillers have skyrocketed.

But this isn't just about what I can do as President. Every single one of us - from citizens to NGOs - can help refugees find safe haven. We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years. We've provided more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of those impacted by the Syrian conflict. Nearly 12 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Syria. As Americans, we can't sit idly by. That's not who we are. I'm grateful for the teachers who helped spark my sense of curiosity. The #62MillionGirls who aren't in school should have that same chance.

When I took office, the budget deficit had reached 9.2% of our GDP. We've cut that down to 2.8%. http://t.co/3viaw4b0bB When I took office, 15.4% of our population was uninsured.

There's no such thing as a \"better deal.\" Walking away risks war. https://t.co/la7GhQXfzl I refuse to condemn our kids to a planet that's beyond fixing. Let's meet this challenge and #ActOnClimate together. Despite what the critics will tell you, this plan will ultimately save the average American family nearly $85 a year on their energy bills. Thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our kids and we'll avoid 3,600 premature deaths in 2030. It's time to change that. With the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be 32% lower than it was a decade ago. Right now, power plants account for about one-third of America\u2019s carbon pollution. That\u2019s more than our cars, airplanes, and homes combined. Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they\u2019ve been in 800,000 years. 2014 was the planet\u2019s warmest year on record. Today, we're announcing America's Clean Power Plan\u2014the most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change. Here are the facts: Hey @StationCDRKelly, loving the photos.

It's a major step toward a safer world.  https://t.co/xwSrH9IoFG Mass incarceration doesn't work. Let's build communities that give kids a shot at success and prisons that prepare people for a 2nd chance. We could eliminate tuition at every public college and university in America with the $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations. The $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations could double the salary of every high school teacher in America. The $80 billion we spend each year to keep people incarcerated could pay for universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America. In 1980, there were 500,000 people in American jails. Today, there are 2.2 million. Many belong. But too many are nonviolent offenders. America keeps more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined. America is home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners. Just spoke to the NAACP about criminal justice reform, something many broadly agree on.

That's why I'm announcing my plan to extend overtime protections. https://t.co/MrV56vTNa9 So inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims' families in Charleston. #HateWontWin http://t.co/jMS0SDUYui Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #LoveWins The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been. Let's keep at it until every American has quality, affordable health insurance. More than 137 million Americans have guaranteed access to preventive care like cancer screenings and birth control at no out-of-pocket cost. Women can no longer be charged more for health coverage just for being women. 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health coverage. More than 16 million Americans have gained health coverage after 5 years of the Affordable Care Act. Today's decision is a victory for every hardworking American. Access to quality, affordable health care is a right, not a privilege. Good luck Team USA \u2013 make us proud out there! #OneNationOneTeam http://t.co/btu3dRXPbr Expressions of sympathy aren\u2019t enough. It\u2019s time we do something about this. Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel. Good point, Mitt. https://t.co/Ryusfp8Xbh In the midst of darkest tragedy, the decency and goodness of the American people shines through in these families. https://t.co/aYtAKrWwCY Inspired by what @Pontifex wrote on climate change. Agree we have a moral responsibility to act to protect our kids and God's creation. Thrilled to formally recognize @LorettaLynch as the people's lawyer. You'll have no better partner in the fight for equality and justice. What a team win for the Warriors and an epic season for Steph. Kudos to LeBron and the Cavs for an unbelievable effort under adversity. Congrats to my hometown @NHLBlackhawks on 3 titles in 6 years - we'll see you and The Cup at the White House! So proud of these White House mentorship grads. Can't wait to see all the great things you achieve. I believe in you! http://t.co/ao6k8ErjHI I challenged them to a race. http://t.co/FpEUTnYgoD This was a fun briefing: My science advisor just showed me this Hubble shot of the most crowded place in our galaxy. http://t.co/E2SeO9tumt Glad the Senate finally passed the USA Freedom Act. It protects civil liberties and our national security. I'll sign it as soon as I get it. Awarded two Medals of Honor today for acts of bravery a century ago. We honor our heroes no matter how long it takes. http://t.co/AYazTecZpB RT @JustineinTampa: @POTUS I'm 30 now, but I've been promoting climate change since I was in the third grade! #ActOnClimate http://t.co/d77\u2026 RT @LizHadly: @POTUS Love the #ActOnClimate. As scientist, I say global action more important than science now. #WeKnowEnoughToAct. Thanks for the questions! This was fun. I've got to run, but let\u2019s do it again soon. Tell me what you're doing to #ActOnClimate. .@apat246 @chicagobulls love thibs and think he did a great job. Sorry to see him go but expect he will be snatched up soon by another team. .@ZCarlander agreement with China big and will be working w Brazil to develop their plans. We will all need to do more with US leading .@arianastover Kids instinctively understand importance of environment, impact on animals, health. Weave it into science and social studies .@HtetWint renewable energy key, already increased solar 10x and wind 3x, now need to invest more in r&amp;d and provide regulatory incentives . @Jamesthe4tress Already expanded Pell Grants and capped student loan interest rates; now want to make 2 yrs of community college free. @HLF3267 In fact new trade deal with have the strongest enforceable environmental provisions in history, raising standards across Asia. .@ZCarlander more severe weather events lead to displacement, scarcity, stressed populations; all increase likelihood of global conflict. .@NathenVieira jr smith having a great season but the heart of the Cavs is Lebron. And no one can outshoot Curry - maybe Korver if wide open @.gkermmm 2/ after I sign agreement, Congress will have months of debate before a vote. Nothing secret about it. .@gkermmm 1/ TPP is still being negotiated! But legislation requires the full text for 60 days before I sign. .@drock89 as @Pontifex and other religious leaders have stated we have a moral obligation to the most vulnerable and the next generation. .@BigBennyFL 3/ already rejected Shell's original proposal as inadequate which shows we're serious. .@BigBennyFL 2/ But since we can't prevent oil exploration completely in region we're setting the highest possible standards @BigBennyFL 1/ We've shut off drilling in the most sensitive arctic areas, including Bristol Bay. .@calebmegajew the science is overwhelming but what will move Congress will be public opinion. Your voices will make them open to facts. Ready to answer your questions on climate change. Let's do this! #AskPOTUS http://t.co/5KrIb5jL6S Just got a hurricane preparedness briefing in Miami. Acting on climate change is critical. Got climate Qs? I'll answer at 1pm ET. #AskPOTUS Spent the morning at Arlington. Take time today to honor our fallen heroes. We're forever indebted to their families. http://t.co/hChhhOVCS3 .@DrFahmida tell your niece I really like her letter. Couldn't agree more! .@rebsteve really enjoyed stopping by today. I had fun singing Shabbat Shalom with the PreK class downstairs, too! http://t.co/6b8CrXSgMt An honor to address the Coast Guard class of 2015. Confident they'll help us meet big challenges like climate change. http://t.co/1z4fteA1YJ Good question, @billclinton. The handle comes with the house. Know anyone interested in @FLOTUS? In Camden today, seeing first-hand how smart policing is making the community safer while building trust. http://t.co/3MiWk43c8g Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really!
