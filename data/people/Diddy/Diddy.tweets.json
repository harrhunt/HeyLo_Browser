He\u2019s one of the most genuine and intelligent black leaders we\u2019ve ever had. We cannot go against each other, there\u2019s not enough of us. I\u2019m also proud of my brother JAY Z for showing how it should be done! It\u2019s time to play chess not checkers, I believe he is going to do some incredible things. I\u2019m so proud of @Kaepernick7 and the attention he was able to bring and the efforts he continues to make. I\u2019ll continue to support him in every way possible. Hov is one of the greatest to ever do it, he has been there more than anybody from the hip hop culture, including me. He\u2019s always been so selfless and fights for other people.
