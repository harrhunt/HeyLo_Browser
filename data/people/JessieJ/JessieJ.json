I'm not talking about me. \nI'm talking about anyone.  https://t.co/s1B7XHI0qu Just fed up of seeing people make a joke out of someone's dark moments.When if it if was being done to them in theirs.They'd hate it.Fact. We are all human. We all need love. We can save each other. But we live in a world where people will slow down at a car crash and take a picture before they jump out to help. The media too man. Stop exploiting people when they are falling. Papz following people in their darkest moments for what? A cheap story. Anyone who needs a little love and support.Be there.When it's the worst.Be the vitamin to their deficiency.Be a light for them. So when your energy is low you need positivity and support. Why as a generation don't we get that yet? \nMy point is... Be nice. Support. When you are sick you put goodness into your body to feel better, right? Better food, medicine etc right? Be there for someone when they are falling to try help catch them. Not just the person that \"cares\" when they hit the ground. Next time you think about making a Instagram joke or to judge someone.Really think.If this was about me,if I felt really low would it help? The love people will happily give someone when it may be too late, is often the love they really needed to survive when they were falling.

The journey continues \ud83c\udf7a *cheers* \n(That's a shandy) \ud83d\ude09 Being an artist is so fulfilling and terrifying at the same time. \nBut I love it. I know no other way. In saying all of this. I am excited to explore further into the feeling. To reflect on where I have been at my best and where I have not. Not sugar coated. But as it really is. Lyrics and melody change accordingly to feeling. As life changes. So do we. Music and singing are the only things I have ever known that make me feel what I feel transparently. Face to face with life. The feelings we want and need and the feelings we don't. They all matter. And to make other people feel what they need and want to feel. One thing will never change. The reason why I make music and sing. To make myself feel free, to understand what my heart feels. All of it. My hair. My body. My fashion. My makeup. My nails. My life. My wants. My needs. My priorities. Have all changed a lot over past 10 years. So here I am. 27. 10 years into being signed where my journey as Jessie J began. The heartbeats who love my music, my voice, are respectful and understanding. Even if we have never met. I see you. You keep me going. You buy the music, come to my shows, sing along. Hold me up on a good day. Hold me up on a bad day. But my biggest thank you. Is to my heartbeats. My fans. You are with me through choice. And for that I will feel forever grateful. After 10 years I am so happy I still have that. I don't expect I don't presume. I work hard. I try my best to create from the inside out. I didn't know what I was in for at 17 years old stepping into the world of music. I have days now where it feels unreal. A dream. My label, my management, my publishers, my pr, my band, my team and all included on this ride. I am so thankful to work with special people. My journey so far has been so real. I've had huge success and songs out no one really noticed. Lol. Takes time to build the 'perfect' team. I argue artist may never. And maybe that's a good thing. Because you never settle. You always push. I have had both good and bad label experiences and both whilst having music out and known and also being completely unknown. It provides a platform to work alongside incredible creative people and a chance to build on your vision. Being signed doesn't create success overnight and it certainly doesn't give you all you ever wanted on a golden plate.. This year marks my 10th year being signed... Crazy Also my last festival of 2015 and the last UK show this year. That obviously  called for a dramatic hair change...  \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb My first 70min set tonight in 2 months.
