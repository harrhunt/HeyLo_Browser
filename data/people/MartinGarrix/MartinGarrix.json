If I showed up at every festival with just a dj booth, no pyro sfx/led walls and 0 people crew instead of 20, your comment would make some sense. @cemian that's not the right mindset. the moment you think you need money to be happy is so wrong. family, friendships, don't need money for that and those are the things that are fundamental in being happy. offcourse money is nice, but if you got no one to share it with it's useless. everyone deserves happiness I'm a Dreamer... \nhttps://t.co/UVxg71oYjF @MikeYung https://t.co/EROLejko35 Life = Crazy! https://t.co/5cdS7BgTAY https://t.co/IJYip1Lf8q RT @GMA: THURSDAY ON #GMADay with @sarahaines &amp; @michaelstrahan: @MartinGarrix &amp; @MIKEYUNG perform #Dreamer in Times Square!
