And at the end just felt for the kiwis. England played amazing cricket. But so did the kiwis. They didn\u2019t deserve to be second.  No way. This World Cup should have been shared. If England got more boundaries. New Zealand took more wickets. So the criteria is absurd. All 22 of those boys gave their everything and no one was lesser.
