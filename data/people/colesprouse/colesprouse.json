Don\u2019t forget to acknowledge your father on social media today. We have lost one of best the US has to offer. Anthony was all the independence and curiosity of the fevered American dream coupled with an honest and considerate love of people and otherness. To travel humbly and fight to show this humanity, was the character of a true diplomat. @docshaw yeah im not worried about you There should be a dating app for people who post motivational quotes, they\u2019re clearly all single.

My heart goes out to all affected by this. And so also need to address what part of whiteness influences this kind of Petri dish for gun violence and killing. We also must address that these shooters are almost exclusively coming from a single socio-economic class and racial group The mind of these villains hungry for attention. This video does a much better job explaining it than I can: https://t.co/nm1tTSyBVg Aside from the many other legal and institutional reasons guns need to be better controlled, news outlets need to recognize how they affect This makes media complicit in the creation of these shooters as anti-heroes, and often alone justifies the insane to take to shooting. The childhood, habits, social and professional life, etc, are all covered a great deal. for weeks after the event, and often internationally Media has a tremendous role to play in the cultivation of mass shooters. Constant coverage and in-depth \"analysis\" of the life of shooters- As someone raised within media culture, let me give my two cents on this gun violence, a now unfortunately characteristic part of US life: Not all heroes wear capes...just the fucken sexy ones #WhyImStillSingleIn4Words\n\nMiss Piggy hasn't called.

Beware of the people who celebrate your success more than you do. This country will see improvement in the form of quality education. Respect your teachers, the job they do is one of love, not of money. Sad how, through our constant media coverage, we've turned this most recent crazed gunman into an antihero; stop making these people popular I wish I could just slip out from under the table like when I was a kid.  Could you imagine doing that at a business meeting? Loving how many other young people of recognition there are who pursue higher education.  Makes me feel unique. The greatest of tricks have a way of appealing to all 5 of our senses.  These are the ones we must be most careful of. RT @satangranny666: Cole sprouse is the kind of person that would attend every creed concert Nothing is worse than a passionate complaint about an institution with no suggestion of an alternative. You can change what you truly hate. It's a shame the common media production of female sex appeal is vulnerability. Where are the Joan of Arcs, the Bradamantes? Righteousness Breaking away from romantic surrealisms is part of growing older.

If your reasons are sound, tell them why you disagree. @catherine10121 same as being extremely loved funny enough @harrydise finger nails because they grow back.  If I had cheeto fingers, I would most likely eat them and have no finger or nails. Egypt dig program canceled due to unforeseen political tensions. Nothing I can do about it.
