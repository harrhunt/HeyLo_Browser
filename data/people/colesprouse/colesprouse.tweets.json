This video does a much better job explaining it than I can: https://t.co/nm1tTSyBVg Aside from the many other legal and institutional reasons guns need to be better controlled, news outlets need to recognize how they affect This makes media complicit in the creation of these shooters as anti-heroes, and often alone justifies the insane to take to shooting.
