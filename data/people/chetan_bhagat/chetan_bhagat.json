Issues are tough but still in resolvable state, if all stakeholders act swiftly. Interesting to see how this develops. Has wider implications for Indian economy. Yes Bank needs a staggering $1bn-$2bn in new capital to keep running. All this, while it deals with bad news, massive stock declines, black box loan book, plummeting confidence and promoter already having sold stake. It is not easy at all to raise that kind of money. Happened with Kingfisher. Happened with Jet. When trouble begins, Indian procedures are so slow and cumbersome that recovery is v difficult. Confidence crisis makes it worse. Worried about Yes Bank the same way. Be safe. Extremely concerned for Yes Bank. Love it. Thanks. And great sketches and presentation too!

Sir you have the right to your views but 1) 370 was removed by an elected parliament, after the region failed to be fixed. comparing it to Babri mob is incorrect. 2) Babri caused riots, we r trying to prevent them right now.

Given the current situation in @INCIndia, will Sachin Pilot be one of the better choices than older veterans to take over as Cong President? Whatever happens @INCIndia, think about the people of this country and what is best for them. The time for change has come. Don't be afraid to embrace it. And serve this great nation. @milinddeora @SachinPilot @JM_Scindia \"The best bet right now seems to be Sachin Pilot,\" had said this in Feb-18. And the time has now come to see what @INCIndia does. I know for a fact that many young leaders of the @INCINdia will be happy with and will back @SachinPilot   https://t.co/torLIxHoD3 Have been mentioning @SachinPilot 's name since a long time now as the possible new face for the Congress.

Accept the new reality and choose a leader who gives you the best chance to reform for the future. Yes. Despite being one of the strong leaders in the Congress, @capt_amarinder is smart enough to realize that the new leader needs to be someone who can win and connect, and is not just a matter of seniority. https://t.co/0yZvuTzEqe \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/WW0yV40Yce \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/By0D2DvwyC There are so many good writers.

This will lead to us no longer having the best doctors we can have and will aggravate the healthcare crisis further. I support India's doctors, who are amongst the best in the world. They work tirelessly, often to compensate for an inadequate healthcare system. Still they are judged, threatened, shamed for trying to make decent living and their genuine issues aren't heard. #SupportIndianDoctors The kind of pic that makes my day. New India.

It is important we remain calm and stick to proper sources for our information. https://t.co/gQB1kXecGE Reacting when our soldiers are killed isn't war mongering, it is self defence. Nobody in India wants war. We were happily waiting for the next Bollywood film or cricket match before they backed a terror attack at Pulwama. They did it first. We had no choice but to teach a lesson. Great job by the IAF. And great choice of words by govt \"non-military preemptive action against terrorists (and not against Pak)\". Makes it difficult for Pak to escalate. Josh and Hosh both on display. Very well done. #IndianAirForce #IndiaStrikesBack When you slap us, we will no longer turn the other cheek.

Love and peace to all. #DurgaAshtami RT @chetan_bhagat: So who wanted to kiss whom? @iratrivedi\u2019s self-explanatory email from 2013 to me, esp last line, easily shows her claims\u2026 I am not a vindictive person. More than anything I just want me and my family to be left alone and people to ignore fake charges.  Love to all who supported me. I won\u2019t let you down. This was my #MeToo story. Peace out. Annoyed by my revelations, more baseless, twisted attacks may come on me, through her friends, wellwishers &amp;/or others. Neither obligated nor inclined to respond. Please don\u2019t believe such nonsense. I may go silent on twitter to heal my family but I won\u2019t be shamed or silenced. To those who abused me last few days, hope you will do right by me now. Ultimately, is this movement about the truth or blindly supporting a particular gender? Please don\u2019t let your biases make you believe things that are not true. A person\u2019s reputation is their most prized asset and takes a lifetime of work to earn. To have these motivated, fake attacks on me is abhorrent and the sickest thing a person can do. Please don\u2019t support this kind of smear campaign. Shame on media like @outlookindia who carried a fake charges story without even checking with me. They could have easily checked on YouTube that I launched her book in 2015/16. Who calls their harasser as chief guest for their book launch? Video here: https://t.co/g6uIOVLjeS Also, it is she who comes from very powerful family connected to pol party (regularly dropped top names of people in power then ). i was less known in 2010. was intimidated by her.

It's her https://t.co/GGNGjZgbz9 So who wanted to kiss whom? @iratrivedi\u2019s self-explanatory email from 2013 to me, esp last line, easily shows her claims from 2010 are false, and she knows this too.

I still remember https://t.co/oGjQdpX6qQ @donaldsvd @KabirHu58453370 i didn't ask you to.. but again u never really defended your point. so was just a random opinion. @donaldsvd @KabirHu58453370 not defending anything. again try to back up your opinions with something substantial. i like that mithai tweet, got a great response. neither was this tweet any kind of defense. if u want to be taken seriously please back up your claims. @YashMirchawala coz if u bother to click the link u will see it is #1 bestseller in india. thanks. @santy_a14 it is meant for the BJP, who face the music now. they can't wish it away and the political optics are bad. that's what i said and saying it again. like i said, there was no bias. scrapping deal also means BJP faces music and can't wish it away. hope u get it. @santy_a14 @BJP4India @INCIndia yes its just an opinion. the tone is pretty strong, maybe i am not matching your emotion but that doesn't make me biased. i prefer to know all the facts before raising my tone. chill. just don't accuse without reason or without backing up claims The Girl in Room 105: #1 National Bestseller already on pre-orders alone!

Can you explain? Or your own biases are at play here? @santy_a14 i really don't know what is the bias in my statement? pls back your statement with some facts and not just random opinions. In all the cacophony, we may never really know whatever happened in Rafale. However, the political optics of having a name like Ambani on a defense deal are just bad. And now you can't wish it away. Mr PM considering you wanted to be a beacon of peace, don\u2019t you think you needed to be more patient than attacking the moment things didn\u2019t go your way? Our people were killed, difficult to do a hugs session the day that happened isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t give up if u r serious about peace https://t.co/uIABdqjvQU Explaining thing in layman terms doesn\u2019t make you a layman. In fact, it requires a level of clarity and understanding to be able to do so. Relax. Am just giving an analogy so people understand the deal and in a lighter vein. Divert your anger somewhere else. https://t.co/DCrvrHQzqt I like to simplify issues so maximum number of people understand it. Those who hide behind complex arguments know their hollowness pretty well. Remember, it is not that simple to be simple. This elitist arrogance is an example of people who don\u2019t want issues to be simplified or get more people involved in a debate. Because you know, only they the so-called intellectuals must own and debate issues. Please ignore such bullies and discuss issues however you want. https://t.co/1aIs7EjfwL Interesting take.

Read the full interview here: https://t.co/lQZ1dzfX\u2026 Trying to understand the Rafale situation better. There are just too many versions at the moment. Any genuine suggestions on some good articles to read on the same? Be civil please and do share the links. Sometimes when info is not adequate or conflicting the best thing to say is we don\u2019t have enough to form a view rather than jump to conclusions. This is a developing situation, better to be patient and see what everyone has to say. https://t.co/yaWHsp0nyP #RafaelDeal simplified analogy. Say you order mithai for the neighbourhood, but tell the halwai to take the milk from your bhaiya only. Did someone actually say that? Was milk taken at a fair price? Did halwai choose the milk seller on his own based on quality? We don\u2019t know yet. So now current French govt says something else vs. what ex-French prez Hollande said on the #RafaelDeal. Looks like their politics is just as complicated as ours. With so many versions and few clarifications, impossible to form a view on this at this point. Indian Government Chose Anil Ambani For Rafale, with no choice - Says ex-French Prez Francois Hollande, according to news reports.   This is a serious charge and about time our government verified and clarified this, and did it fast. That is a tough question.

It is a tough call and I don't really know if it will play out like that. Interesting Facts about Petrol Prices:\nCurrent Retail Price: Rs80/liter\nPrice if no central/govt taxes: Rs43/liter\nPrice if brought under GST(28%): Rs55/liter\nPrice if same taxation rates as were there in 2014: Rs63/liter\n\nTaxes have risen a lot, and are now at 84% for petrol. Most ad revenues have shifted to Facebook and Google. Media houses, no matter which govt in power, will never be as powerful as they used to be. Kudos to those who still try to be independent. We need a new term. Journotainment. Many news channels fit in that category and should be officially called so. I love u too. U r doing a great job! https://t.co/z4sUaSkh3p Why is she reacting to chota so much? Like to every tweet.  We know love is blind. https://t.co/kiBYP5vyGW @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya Sad. What u have become. Refusing to listen. Stuck to your beliefs. Goats belong to herds. Not me. God bless u. RT @chetan_bhagat: Modi haters be like:\nHater: You are scared to speak on fuel prices in Modi regime\nMe: I just did that\nHater: No u didn't\u2026 @Neruda_Frost @rupagulab @kunfaaya Did u see my tweets from yest? But see v hard to admit u r wrong on twitter. U get shamed in front of ur followers. So keep repeating urself @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya Rap on knuckles now? First u said he dare not. And savage or not it\u2019s all in your head. And i just proved u wrong. Do say that he criticised even tho it was a rap to your echo chamber followers. And no. Cant hate as much to win u over. @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya See my tweets from yesterday. Expected better from you than to lie and high five your friends. Your choice. @szjilani @rachnaburman Name and dp were a bit confusing (she has to clarify in her bio) and apologise for the genuine error. Btw she did judge me without knowing me and my book before it even released. Maybe she needs to learn something too and u need to learn something about fairness too? @ashwaqM @RaisinaSeries See the problem? Nothing I do will shake ur confirmation bias. U prove the tweet. How sweet Self goal tweet? Am sorry. I didn\u2019t understand this graph. Can u please explain why the yellow bar is smaller in size despite value being higher?! https://t.co/8pOHmHXM0f Modi haters be like:\nHater: You are scared to speak on fuel prices in Modi regime\nMe: I just did that\nHater: No u didn't do it with as much anger\nMe: Ok, am really upset\nHater: Ok abuse Modi now, like really badly\nMe: well why should I?\nHater: see..bhakt bhakt bhakt! To many, my views on the country's fuel prices and currency movements are more important than the country's fuel prices or the currency movements themselves. Flattery comes in many forms. @swamv39 rakho sambhal ke..how sweet :) tum jaise troll sabko milein. so cool! https://t.co/KOjDx3v8VZ I can't. I could probably have a decent set of policies if in that position, but I can't win elections because I refuse to and am unable to play the identity and shady politics that is needed to win elections in India today. So, apologies. Can't. https://t.co/TydMJausbf Not at all. But screaming and shouting doesn't make you a better analyst. In fact you gain credibility by keeping a balance and using emotions selectively. Don't worry about my heart rate, which is pretty low btw. Petrol prices on the other hand..:) https://t.co/yB3nO9xtKX GST is not just a formula. It is a way of indirect taxation where the indirect tax rates r fixed and doesn't depend on someone judging the product as good/bad/luxury/essential and then setting rates like we did in the 60s. Only works if everything moves into GST - including fuel. A scam needs more data points than just mere allegations. There were CAG reports, invoices of purchases made in CWG etc etc. If that happens in this govt, it too will get scam-ridden. So far, there has not been solid basis. Just stating the situation. https://t.co/VzewJg1sFL Pointed out high fuel prices in previous regimes. Have also done it now. For those asking why I sounded angrier then, then we had high prices PLUS a scam-a-week. A student who gets lo marks as well as cheats will get scolded more than the student who just gets lo marks right? To give credit where due, she's v funny and witty :) https://t.co/ruOnlFg2RD Another contest coming up with great prizes. Tip: Watch this trailer carefully, noticing every detail. Will help you win! Watch here: The Girl in Room 105- Chetan Bhagat-  Book Trailer https://t.co/MGpaqFLMql Am all for fiscal prudence but to overtax fuel and then spend thousands of crores paying for Air India\u2019s losses and funding bank NPAs also doesn\u2019t seem to be the best way to do things. Petrol Diesel prices too high. Said it before saying it now. Taxation on fuel needs to be revisited. People are suffering. Inflation will rise. Why not just simply bring it under GST? Hi guys, read the first chapter of \u201cThe Girl in Room 105\u201d here: https://t.co/yMFAkp6TOU Remember this.

Some Q &amp; A about the book here: https://t.co/lzHUO5esfy I am sure you deserve it too sir but would request you not to malign my institute\u2019s name and the others who have won, with your allegations that have no basis. The IITs are fair, and frankly don\u2019t think the BJP cares about a college\u2019s internal awards. https://t.co/rpxM82KMKj I am sorry.

RT @ASShishism: Lucid writing, and high on impact. Good one @chetan_bhagat. You\u2019ve continued your tradition of putting forth your POV with\u2026 @saliltripathi @somakghoshal Never said otherwise. Just wanted to say it affects a lot more people than many would think. Don\u2019t assume or react to things which haven\u2019t been said please. @yash_chetan Never said otherwise. Just wanted to say it affects a lot more people than many would think. Don\u2019t assume things which haven\u2019t been said please. Survey matches scientific data. Around 10% of the population could be LGBT. That\u2019s 100mn+ people in India. Not a small number. Hence 377 verdict v important. https://t.co/UyS79tFEiN Thanks @Tutejajoginder ! https://t.co/Z6g6nibbFx Thank you Director-sir, this is such a big honour for me.

Thank you! https://t.co/77Qzru8MMs Before allegations like these start flying, it would be good if regulators look into global payment platforms and rectify this. https://t.co/8M0KiS54Y3 @ChauhanSydney @TathagatINC @bainjal kal tweet kiya tha rupee ke baare mein. bore mat karo..don't tag me at least if u wanna keep going with ur versions of who i am. and no, can't hate modi as much as u guys do.. sorry, find someone else to troll.

Someone should look into the same and work out a solution. https://t.co/kCp3tE9Y4D India is a country where the culture changes every 100km. Accepting diversity has to be the core value of every Indian and frankly is the only way India will survive and thrive. Scrapping #Section377 is a step in that direction. It is a good day for India. So #Section377 is decriminalized. An outdated law that needed to go. Congrats to all! For those who want to understand the issue and why it needed to be scrapped. My earlier column : \"Section 377 is our collective sin: https://t.co/DSpZcbF6CC via @TOIOpinion As SC rules on #Section377 verdict, it is important for us to know that gay community exists and suffers because of this law. How many of you, privately or openly, identity yourself as gay (individual votes are not visible to others on Twitter) Twitter discussions never work because if one is wrong on Twitter and the other side even proves it, one ends up being shamed in front of their followers. Hence, everyone remains stuck to their positions and never listens. And so the polarisation only rises. The Girl in Room 105- Chetan Bhagat-  Book Trailer https://t.co/MGpaqFubyN via @YouTube If there are people here who can think beyond whether it was the BJP or Congress\u2019 fault and think about what is actually good for the country, let me know. Would be nice to see some people who actually care about India first. Just the two tweets before the one u r replying to were on exactly that so I don\u2019t even know what to say to u or the likes of u. Is not reading and throwing statements the new cool? Just saying.. https://t.co/Zh3g2H1Reo Why do people compare Modi with Manmohan Singh? Should be with Sonia Gandhi. Have we forgotten who was in power then? Have always spoken on issues, no matter which govt at centre.Those saying otherwise are misleading you. And sorry while I do criticise govt when needed,I don\u2019t hate Modi and I can\u2019t do that to get entry into your elite club. Hope you are liberal enough to allow me to be this way. Whatever the other issues, the govt move to  create India Post Payments Bank, that seeks to leverage the infrastructure, personnel and reach of India Post is highly appreciated. Such innovative ideas is what makes the country progress. Well done. Arresting poets? Like seriously. The Rupee, although stable for last couple of years and a modest decline is expected, has fallen too much lately. While other factors remain, shows international confidence is economy is not as strong as it should be. Neither UPA nor NDA could hold Rupee strong. Sad. Petrol prices too high. Don\u2019t know why state taxes are not capped. It\u2019s almost like the states make more money when crude oil goes higher. Shouldn\u2019t it be the opposite? Sorry been a bit busy with book announcements etc to talk about national issues. It\u2019s not silence, just busy. Back now. Whatever I have achieved is due to my teachers. Just wanted to thank them all. #HappyTeachersDay Hi guys, Here is the exclusive first chapter of \u201cThe Girl in Room 105\u201d https://t.co/yMFAkp6TOU RT @YahooIndia: Chetan Bhagat Reveals \u2018Movie-Style Promo\u2019 of New \u2018Unlove Story\u2019\nhttps://t.co/b0jfzOJznz RT @Spotboye: Check out the mind-boggling trailer of @chetan_bhagat's latest book - #TheGirlInRoom105 directed by @mohit11481 &amp; features ac\u2026 Directed by Mohit Suri @mohit11481 featuring Vikrant Massey ( @masseysahib ).

It isn't the device, it is what's happening in your mind. Reading triggers your imagination. Videos do not. Just because I want to have more books and less screen doesn't mean I don't like the screen. Saying but you are typing this on a screen is also so silly. We don't need to polarise every darn thing in the world and make it into this vs that. Love screen. Love books. The screen is important. It is fun too. I love it. But books also have their place and magic. It's not books vs screen, it is making them co-exist. Lifts and escalators are great. But you will always have and need stairs.

See u soon Arithmetic and whether an election is multi-cornered or not matters so much in Indian elections, but is somehow not discussed as much. #bypoll The Modi wave even at its peak gave BJP a few %age points vote share lead. With the wave ebbing, and opposition uniting, simple arithmetic making it very difficult for the BJP to win in several places. Good or bad, shows what 2019 could be like for India. Appointing a Hindu religious figure as the UP CM gave opposition the legitimacy to come together for a common cause. Costing BJP dearly now in UP. Today's BJP won 1 seat in LS (out of 4) and 1 in assembly (out of 11). Almost as cruel a joke as the 1 paise reduction in petrol price. #bypoll Hey it is not 1 paisa per litre.

If you are a troll, vote and side with one party and keep screaming in their defense all day long on twitter. Hate Modi or BJP. You have the right to. But think twice before painting Congress in pure gold. Don't forget massive scams in their time, where spectrum, coal and even games weren't spared.Citizens have to make a choice during elections, but then must keep all parties accountable sweet cartoon. but my views are the same - excise duty on fuel is too high - in 2010 and in 2018. under UPA or BJP. for hindus or muslims. in summer and winter. for vegetarians and non vegetarians. for dalits and non dalits. now focus on the issue and stop ur divisive thinking https://t.co/ZPHp3UI22a @boblezley baby go learn to troll properly at least. saying the same thing. emojis don't make u cool, make u look like a fool. GST works only if everything, ALL products and services are under GST. Else it is just the govt trying to keep control that it never wants to give up - and hence we will never get the full benefits of GST to the economy. @boblezley ole baby, cute little troll..get a life..oh wait, u don't have one. @RajivGupta11 chup..bhaago chalo..u called me bhakt, that shows u r a troll. that's ur leaning. go run first it was u don't criticise BJP, now when i proved that lie it is well u do criticize them but use sober vocabulary with bjp, what else next? i don't raise my eyebrows that high when i criticize BJP? silly fools. abuse them or u aren't objective is it? https://t.co/kw4MQKuuw0 @RajivGupta11 i can't keep commenting everyday on fuel taxes or when some idiot wants me to. i do it when i want to as it is my account. i am a man and u are a small minded little troll. go get a life. Tweeted this 8 years ago. I still stand by it, no matter what regime we are in (so small minded trolls get a life, learn to focus on issues than cheer for your side.). Either way, fuel is taxed too much. It needs to come under GST frankly but for now taxes need to go down. https://t.co/Ioc1OIraNL Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel. Come to India.

Nobody can break u unless some of your own allow it to happen. MLAs are not babies that someone will come and steal.

Now hope will have grace to admit you were wrong in attacking me. It means hard and shrewd bargaining, esp in politics. Sleep well. Good night. https://t.co/VhT2vbUQkz @anirbanblah No. Not necc. Nobody is dialing back. Correct ur understanding. Read the definition. And cash makes it illegal. U assume and comment away that\u2019s fine. I am not embracing or endorsing anything. I am holding a mirror as that is a writer\u2019s job. Don\u2019t like what is shows? Well, not the mirror\u2019s fault. https://t.co/imf4ZGVv3B Lol true. https://t.co/AXFGFpLBSD @anirbanblah No sir. U are not reading my tweet properly. Cash makes it illegal. Not political moves. Keep bias aside kabhi and read things in context. Expecting politics without unethical behaviour is like expecting Jalebis without sugar and oil. Theoretically possible, practically does not work. The best we can hope for is nothing illegal. Ethics work on twitter, not in hung houses. Lol true. https://t.co/0eVBO0RgGg RT @chetan_bhagat: @Memeghnad No bro. Trading doesn\u2019t have to involve money. Come support me I will give u LS ticket. Or CM post. It is all\u2026 @Memeghnad No bro. Trading doesn\u2019t have to involve money. Come support me I will give u LS ticket. Or CM post. It is all technically legal horse trading. Money makes it illegal. Jumping on me coz of your biases is also. Well. Horse like. Fair summary. Just want this who is ethical and who is not ethical discussions to stop. I don\u2019t mean to glorify anything either. Just keep it all in context pls and not quote partially. https://t.co/JT7MDfPKbB Why is Twitter so obsessed about, while Instagram is so clueless about any elections in the country? Genuine question I am looking for a good answer to. Don\u2019t say it out of context. 1) we are in a hung house, there\u2019s no disney solution here. 2) horse trading doesn\u2019t have to involve money, can just be real politics, 3) tossing a CM post to a 38 seat party you hated before results is just as bad as horse trading https://t.co/wMbiW2NXjA In a hung parliament there\u2019s no ethical way out. So let\u2019s stop moralizing either side please as it is a pointless exercise. Even horse trading is an art form. another test for both BJP and Cong. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s better at it.

My lord sorry. @mazii1000 it's wrong to tax so much. i give views. i don't destroy my credibility by calling it sham or putting silly labels. a bad policy is just that. yeh baat bhi sahi hai. Dar nahi hai, par koi galat baat faila raha ho to clarify karne me harz bhi nahi hai. https://t.co/31rOzQFL1u There are some Modi haters who want me to write hate tweets about Modi govt else they threaten to keep calling me biased. Not going to work. Have roughly an equal no of articles pro-anti BJP/Cong. So I know what I am doing. Sorry I can't be a mouthpiece of your hate. Have said many times we need One-GST and fuel price excise is too high. We did not have GST in 2014. Rest of the tweets in 2014 were on fuel rationing being proposed which we don't have now. Hating Modi (or any other leader) doesn't make anyone more neutral. Now go get a life. https://t.co/evifJTKNa1 1) cos there's no scams happening. Screaming without reason spoils my credibility. 2) Have written lots on BJP's issues, 3) Have explained INR in tweets, see it, 4) Excise duties on petrol too high have said it many times we need One-GST, 5) Get a life. https://t.co/MiK23a0jLG You need to be involved and have a view, but not waste too much time on politics and develop yourself too.

It is from 2013. We are in 2018.  60 to 67 in 5years is a depreciation of 2.2% per annum, which is way lower than $-INR interest rate differential (~6% per annum) or diff in $-INR inflation rates.

Thank you guys for still remembering the film. v close to my heart. https://t.co/qNmUi3rw8G Over 38k votes in this twitter poll. 58% believe Modi govt performance below expectations, many even calling it well below. somewhat unusual Twitter result where Modi supporters outnumber others. https://t.co/Dq9Djltg4u @shilpitewari @DurgeshILikeYou i do get that. however, there's a problematic interpretation there as well. @shilpitewari are you serious? there's no difference between a fiction title vs an official national slogan to protect women? Are you being funny? or is that how u think? #gorakhpurbypolls #NiravModi #icicibankscam #FakeNews #SCSTAct #Unnao #Kathua #CashCrunch - all these news have come right after the other, harming the BJP's image. A lot to introspect for the party. Another week with bad headlines for the BJP with #CashCrunch, after #Kathua and #Unnao which was after #SCSTAct.  Bad times for the BJP. Bura Waqt. All those fundamentalists, pray harder you guys. There used to be dry days for alcohol. Now there are dry days for cash. #CashCrunch Oh dear. Is this what they meant by cashless society? People can\u2019t lay hands on their own money? https://t.co/VnccG5ehiL In your honest opinion, compared to what you expected in 2014, the performance of the Modi govt has been: To you, and all who think like you. I don't have change of heart when I analyze politics as politics is not my lover. I believe issues are better understood on a  case by case basis. My views are different depending on situation. Too bad if it's too much for your brain to process https://t.co/pSO5HElUTb Whatever be his personal issues with the PM, this letter is worth reading. BJP has a lot to introspect on. Economy or social issues, things have not gone as planned:  Dear friend, speak up \u2013 The Indian Express https://t.co/qc3sEedq6T Always had a problem with #betibachao slogan. Women r not just someone's betis. They r individual citizens with their own passports. And they have the right to feel safe in their country. Not because we want to bachao our betis. Because they r more than betis. They are citizens. Q: Where were you when (something similar and wrong) happened in the past?\nA: I was here only. We were all here, seeing all wrongs happen in India. But now we want something done about it. Why do wrong things in past justify that wrong things in the present should not be fixed? 8-year old cows have better luck than some 8-year old Indian girls. It shouldn't take a gruesome killing of an 8-year old for people to react. ANY fundamentalism, ANY means ANY, should be nipped in the bud. Else it only gets more evil and ends like this. If this death affected you, swear to yourself - Zero tolerance for fundamentalism. You reach a pinnacle in your career and become a minister or state minister MP or whatever. Then out of political compulsions, you can't even react to the rape and murder of an 8 year old in your country. What use is such power? What's the point of your life? There\u2019s a child\u2019s rape and murder. And then there\u2019s the government\u2019s reaction to the rape and murder. Both can be equally disturbing events. If you are taking political sides in rape cases, you are part of the problem. Today you are okay with the fringe threatening a movie and its cast, tomorrow the fringe is going to rape and kill little girls. I don\u2019t care about your political compulsions, the ideology of your party, your attachment to a religion and your political loyalties. If you don\u2019t crack down hard and do so publicly on those who hurt an 8-yr old girl, you don\u2019t deserve to be an Indian leader. @vineetjaintimes hi Vineet can we talk? DM me please. Steve Jobs was removed. The Uber founder was removed. But how hard the ICICI board is trying to save an employee CEO, when her husband and brother in law were doing business  with the banks biggest NPA. Only in India.

Is this Feminism btw? @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta It was @ShekharGupta \u2018s publication who I admire a lot. Had to alert this writer had intentionally hid my research on the book. That\u2019s what I said first place. Staying silent when people lie about u isn\u2019t also the best thing to do. Am not foolish to display emotions on twitter. @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta I love running :). Am not upset so don\u2019t assume my emotions. Lying has no grace in my books. But to each their own. @vimo_67 @FuschiaScribe That\u2019s fine buddy happens all the time. But if someone just uses crap language without justifying why, it makes them a troll. And they r my cute lil trolls so I love them. Even tho their brains are tiny @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta Sweets she lied.

Has she twisted how I said I researched? No? Lol @adityampaul @PedestrianPoet Read her article please. First para. Nothing is biting me. If you guys had more IQ and less bias and better ethics would have engaged. Tab tak, bye little trolls. :) @adityampaul @PedestrianPoet Am saying she lied about my research. That\u2019s all. Never said or implied anything else so if you react on something I never said u know what that makes u. Maybe another liar? Lol @RashmiNairPhD @Komal_Dubey @SANDIPANMITRA6 @PedestrianPoet Chal jhoothi! Jaa kisi aur ko troll kar..:) Govt should push the ICICI bank desi banker uncles country club board to investigate what happened. Protecting investors who buy Indian shares worldwide is more important than any media hyped individual. Just way too many red flags here. Despite so many red flags and husbands and brother in laws kind of typical Indian cronyism coming out, ICICI bank board (or cosy club) not doing proper investigations and giving clean chit. Tells investors globally don\u2019t buy Indian shares we will do whatever we want and screw you V good article. https://t.co/xtn64qvOZR @RashmiNairPhD @SANDIPANMITRA6 @PedestrianPoet Wow. U r calling me names. Still not reacting to what I said. I said she has either lied or is incompetent because she hid facts to make her case. U have shown who you are, an abuser with zero analytical skills so discussion over. Bye. @RashmiNairPhD @PedestrianPoet Am not losing anything. Pointing out her lies. She has simply lied to make her point. Stop assuming and react on my points I raised, instead of personal attacks. @2bottle_down @ShekharGupta @PedestrianPoet So many women have told me that. But try telling it to elitist liars passing of as journos these days. @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta Nobody explained. They discussed. Each presented their side. Again you are lying. Not to mention shifting your original charge. U r biased and unethical. And maybe a hater. Anyway. Made my point. Tc @ShekharGupta @PedestrianPoet I also interviewed a 100, yes a 100, women over the course of a year before I wrote that book. waxing was a lighter moment. By hiding that fact, that journo has either lied or shown her incompetence. Negates premise and hence the whole article. Does disservice to feminist cause. The big shareholders of ICICI have to take action on the scam. If they don't, minority shareholders like the retail guys who bought shares in the bank are the ones fooled. Why join an Indian bank, reach the top and do scams, when you could have legitimately joined a foreign bank who would have hired you for much more money? Are the wheeling dealings of desi crony capitalism simply more fun? The ICICI alleged scam should be properly investigated. It is not a PSB, so onus is more on ICICI shareholders. If they choose to be wimps in awe of their management because they are oh-so-cool then they deserve to lose their money. Has India been told the Jodhpur jail\u2019s entire menu yet? Because you know, what could be more important? Hi guys, catch me live here: https://t.co/sFln7lE6p8 Visiting @i30_jee at Bangalore today.

We already have so many media houses bowing to the govt, let\u2019s not compromise whatever free media we have left. The government already has an image of being a control freak. This #fakenews order was a bizzare move. India ain\u2019t Russia or China. We are mad, chaotic, foolish sometimes but free. Do not try to change that. You must have a political death wish if you try to gag the media and piss them off one year before elections. #fakenews Nicely made video.

It\u2019s business as usual. https://t.co/Y63E6RgjIc @utterlybutterly When I am only making this statement why u r attacking me for what I haven\u2019t said. Trolling me for what I didn\u2019t even say. New levels of idiocy. U r being emotional in ur hate. Not me. Only fools get emotional in politics (many found on twitter too.) SP-BSP, BJP-PDP, BJP-TDP, Cong-NCP all tell you one thing: it\u2019s a business. If you falling in love with or hating a leader/party joke is on you. @khannadhiraj78 ok periods...tc @khannadhiraj78 bypolls show what can happen if SP and BSP come together. and it can be replicated in UP. hard for you to understand looks like. like i said, you are rude. maybe just u, not your parents' fault :) @khannadhiraj78 see how many LS seats they contribute and if it moves the probability at all. and am sorry your parents didn't teach you how to talk, no wonder u r so rude. @ZMadon And nobody said it is unprecedented. Also read up on how not to comment without reading what the other person has said. @ZMadon Read enough to not be an elitist and show off my reading habits. Pick a book called dictionary. Look up humility and decency. You may like it. Here's how I think probability of BJP coming back  in 2019 has changed in recent months (totally opinion, nothing scientific). by-polls yest were v significant: \nPost UP Assembly elections: 90%\nPost Guj Assembly elections: 80%\nPost Raj by polls: 75%\nPost UP/Bihar by polls: 65% I think SP and BSP will realize that life is just so much better if they linked their Aadhar cards to each other. All of a sudden, rivals SP and BSP will look into each other\u2019s eyes and find love for each other like never before. :) So @yadavtejashwi , seen as a beginner and written off at one time, is turning into a formidable politician in Bihar. Young, good with words, focused - all helps. Election Victory = power = eventual arrogance = eventual defeat. The circle of life, in politics. BJP landslide victory in UP earlier was because other parties cut each others votes, not because people loved demonetisation. This time they didn\u2019t. It is arithmetic. Not ideology. A+B+C is always greater than A or B or C. #gorakhpur #phulpur The Indian voter ensures no political party ever thinks of itself as indispensable. That\u2019s the beauty of our democracy and that is what has saved our country. #Gorakhpur #phulpur. Aadhar linking deadline extended again. It\u2019s like the nice teacher who pretends to be strict but keeps extending the homework due date. @EcoManOne Considered by who? My readers decide or you do? Lol. Like I said check elitist. One of India\u2019s big problems. @EcoManOne Who deems it? You? Am sure you do. Do check out the definition of elitist too. @EcoManOne Tell me the difference. In words.

The one shining spark - a rising stock market - is also under threat now. Not reducing corporate tax for big corporates was another avoidable move. The mentality that 'big business = bad guys = must keep them under us and in check' runs deep in the govt psyche.  Very hard to change that, and hence we can never get proper growth driven policy. Throwing in ad-hoc taxes every year spooks investors. The Long Term Capital Gain Tax was avoidable. Signals govt will lure you in markets first, then sting you. Not cool. Markets getting whacked. Global cues making it worse. Reintroducing Long Term Capital Gains Tax not the wisest move. Coupled with bad luck of global selloff, stock markets crashing since budget.

India or Mumbai literary scene is not the centre of the world. Of course. Like seriously. @spignal I am indeed flattered you mentioned me with the names you did. But somehow am not a fan of needing Western recognition or approval for a writer to prove their creds. Many elitist Indians feel that way and that\u2019s a shame for the country. Yes sir I know.

Save them for someone special. And thank you. https://t.co/Xw3du038HR Lovely quote. Simple. Entirely true. https://t.co/njmflZ61Uf People signal to politicians what they want and care about. If it is cows over cases so be it. Every politician will follow what society cares about. https://t.co/vAVKYlmIiO When we care about cows and Karni Sena more than governance, things like #2Gverdict happen. It's the citizens who decide their priorities. Screaming about corruption and proving it in court are two different things. #2GVerdict Not a bad day for AAP to speak on the #2GVerdict. It is the system. Not one party or the other. #2GVerdict can be a major, massive  plus for Congress and can be an inflection point for their national recovery. IF they use it well. IF. The scam that changed the government and changed Indian politics forever was not a scam at all? What\u2019s next? No scam in CWG? #2Gverdict It isn\u2019t party specific. There\u2019s something rotten about the system and how it takes citizens for granted when the CAG said it is the biggest scam, the SC canceled licenses, but then everyone involved is acquitted. So the 2G scam was #fakenews?

So fix that. I have a right to have my opinions. If all you can do is give hate, threats and personal attacks in response, reflects more on u. Many people who describe themselves as open minded, liberal and tolerant are ganging up like a mob and abusing the hell out of me today Coz a lot of people love to virtue signal on twitter, don\u2019t know diff between one day and a whole year or how pollution is caused. https://t.co/xhZnVOovHR Stand up for your festival and religion, and this is what you get tagged. Well done guys. https://t.co/G6T3rZfPVu Diwali is 1 day, 0.27% of year. pollution comes from 99.6% days of poor planning and regulation. Fix that. Not make 1 religion feel guilty. And w all respect who decides on what makes a part of a celebration, done for generations, suddenly unholy? And the courts should ban it? https://t.co/YZqzDD8HfB When they can\u2019t logically argue with you. They resort to personal attacks. Usually means you have won. Stay positive. Always. https://t.co/F5NwmgYREz Be careful in your choice of words. That\u2019s all I would say https://t.co/8ANlHZlkH8 So you are going to decide for everyone?

On what basis are you imposing a ban on someone\u2019s traditions? I want to see people who fight to remove crackers for Diwali show the same passion in reforming other festivals full of blood and gore. Diwali one day a year is causing disorders? Or unchecked polluters who pollute everyday? https://t.co/zbv4wMqDje It is one day of the year. Our biggest festival. Uber has saved pollution more than any ban would. Come up with innovations.

Regulate. Don\u2019t ban. Respect traditions. Can I just ask on cracker ban. Why only guts to do this for Hindu festivals? Banning goat sacrifice and Muharram bloodshed soon too? SC bans fireworks on Diwali? A full ban? What\u2019s Diwali for children without crackers? @pzfahad I disagree. Not in my opinion. And we don\u2019t have to match it. To me the loans is the way to go. Just a pov. Nothing to be snarky abt @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth We need to work together for the country. Not attack and form biases. We can learn from each other if we want to. Or just be snarky. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth B) the loans are an issue however. Why did a PSU lend here to a loss making co. That\u2019s what will yield something. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth So a) the turnover tho an issue wont yield much.   Coz u can\u2019t prove wrong doing so easily. Just noise and then nothing. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth Are u asking properly? Or to troll. @pzfahad I just the loans is an issue. Where is the clean chit? Are u lying now as well. Good job @pzfahad See. Once a troll. Always a troll. Chalo. Just wanted to point out to read all tweets. But find something else to be snarky on. Good luck @pzfahad And if a co starts one year and wasn\u2019t there last year is it Infinite growth? Anyway. Issue there is loans. Not turnover percent. @pzfahad No point telling u. u have to show ur friends u are against me. Prob with social media. We never learn. Only wanna reaffirm biases. Sad @pzfahad @thewire_in That\u2019s the same side. Duh. But calling something 16000% growth with a insignificant base is sensational click bait. It\u2019s ok. Not for u :) @pzfahad No it doesn\u2019t. Two sides of the same story can exist. Just because it doesn\u2019t agree with or is beyond you, keep hiding in ur elitism. Tc @pzfahad Did u read all my tweets this is a part of? Thought so. Keep hating Click bait media is a reality today. It means a lot of sensational stories. Even from reputed places. . @thewire_in has never had one nice thing to say about me. I sometimes find them biased too. However. They do not deserve to be bullied. At worst, a powerful govt bullying media is threat to democracy. At best, it is a huge PR disaster on part of govt. Don\u2019t bully, counter. Bullying the media is anti democracy. No govt is worth a threat to our great democracy. The more a political party tries to bury a story, gets defensive or bullies media, the more opposition sniffs the opportunity and attacks.

A good tip for politicians in all this is whenever u have allegations thrown on you, deflect them by doing a demo. Fry eggs or something. Haha\n1. so they thought, ab kaun hack kare, is it?\n2. oh, what about Goa and NE? They didn't sweep those either.\n3. Why? Too slow and lazy? https://t.co/ZykJV8q49p Conspiracy theories apart, trends, analysis, exit polls, variance in results over time all show elections in India are by and large fair. If someone is smart enough to hack EVMs across a million locations secretly, can't they replace boxes with paper ballots? Phir? Was major EVM hacker BJP stupid to allow AAP to win 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi? Or they learnt to hack later? Why they didn't hack Punjab? So all EVMs can be hacked, so in each of 10 lakh booths in India a voter is arranged who punches in secret code,and nobody ever speaks out? That EVM tampering demo is like opening your own car with your own keys and saying every car in the country can be opened with this key.

It isn't something an elitist club decides. Elitistaan theories trying to diss me and  literary value of my books have failed miserably with DU adding my books to their course. Sorry. Am honoured DU added my books to their course. Literature is about being open minded, reading the classics as well as the contemporary. As expected, elitist knickers are in a twist since DU added my books in the Lit course. Open your mind guys.
