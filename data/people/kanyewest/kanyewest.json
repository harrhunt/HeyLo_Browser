We are even stronger because of this through the love and grace of god People said my career was over after TMZ       I need to show the world that we so called crazy people will not be just written off I\u2019ve been trying to do a serious interview speaking on mental health but it seems as though all members of press are afraid to speak to someone who has been diagnosed but is still everyone\u2019s favorite super hero RT @JaidaRaymond: Thank u for being you, goat @kanyewest \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c People try to \u2018handle you when they think you have a mental problem We as a society are taking control of our consciousness and raising it together The paradigm is shifting We love Drake and Trav both love Ye more than anyone and I love those guys back. We love everyone We\u2019re all growing together It\u2019s like when you see a tv show from the 60s and it\u2019s super racist and sexist It reminds me of when I said stop hip hop homophobia      It used to be ok for rappers to bash gay people just listen to certain rap records from the 90s and early 2000s I don\u2019t blame people for not knowing how to handle this that said we as a society will learn together I am able to experience first hand how people who have mental health issues get written off by society.

We are hiring the greatest technical and industrial designers in the world to deliver the highest level of product to ALL CLASS Try to avoid repetition     do meetings in different places and at different times than the normal     break the normal https://t.co/JAw0pMKGqb https://t.co/R1BecN4mMf I'm at Sci-arc and just learned about desalination   Looking at a project by Ashley Morgan Hastings   But I can't tweet the photos \ud83d\ude48 there's a lot of great projects here There's a silent majority of people that have been silenced for too long we're being starved and anyone who starts asking unpopular questions gets demonized. Only free thinkers can change the world we\u2019re in this so-called information age but we're starving for wisdom we're dying to be ourselves Or we\u2019re dying because we've lost our inner child or at least we're dying to be kids We\u2019re all kids What would you do today if you are not afraid of the consequences of failure? what makes kids so important to learn from psychologically is that they are not afraid to fail Art is the escape hatch from oppression Art is the threat to authority energy is contagious We can shape our future. I'm an optimist at my core. I know there will be harmony Remove worry https://t.co/szDOyewQLK\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI'm posting this but not as a diss to J Cole. I love J Cole. I also love where Purp took his flow today is the best day ever and tomorrow's going to be even better Trust your feelings. Stop thinking so much I've got a new challenge for everyone today. Pick somebody that you had an argument with that you think you hate maybe even someone you haven't spoken to in years and contact that person and tell them I love you. Lift Yourself\u00a0\u00a0https://t.co/shjFIROujA I'm going to drop a song with a verse that will bring Ebro the closure he's been seeking \n\nThe bars \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nIt's called Lift Yourself I haven't done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one. I'm just refusing to be enslaved by monolithic thought. Artist transform tragedy into beauty spread love. Put more love into the universe. we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma Instead of doing what you feel \nyou just do what other people think you should do Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people\u2019s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other. the concept of loving people has a stigma my friend said he texted all his friends this morning and said I love you John Legend new single on line now \ud83d\ude02 This is year one. We can't ad empathy to MAGA by hating. We can only ad empathy with love and time and truly hearing all sides I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I'm actually very empathetic. Im still the kid from the telethon. I  feel when people think of MAGA they don't think of empathy. if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I stand my ground. People usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them The world is our family just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person. Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. that's the last tweet of the day. I did that one for my god-brother Puff.  Now ima go watch the Cavs. 2 of my favorite people Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed. Claudio will be awesome when me and Chance build new homes in Chicago Claudio Silverstein is a free thinker Love is the most powerful force in the universe let's move in love not fear And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic \ud83c\udfa4Yeezy shrug \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f whenever someone mentions the word \"fan\" to me it's super manipulative. It's like \"don't do or say this because of your fans\"  My fans are fans of themselves. I want to see a tour with Nikki Minaj and Cardi B I'd like to meet with Tim Cook. I got some ideas need Hype Williams for Nas movie I'm sitting with Lucian discussing the future of the music industry. Lets bring in David Joseph and Frank Bridgman and Olivier Nusse. I'd like Scooter Braun to be a part of this new platform we're creating. Scooter is a genius.  He's more than a manager so is Irving.  We all need to sit together. I'm so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future. I need to meet with Larry from google Google supports YEEZY in ending violence in Chicago to start with we'd be a strategic investor. Not just a VC I'm 40 years old and I'm just now becoming my parents child. I\u2019m nice at ping pong Kids See Ghost short film will be shot by Dexter Navy my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself. Yeezy VC invests in and develops food clothing shelter and communications burn that excel spread sheet \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude02 decentralize fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more. I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say \"I love you\" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more. with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it. And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear. I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. \n\nLove who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary   \nI love Hillary too. You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing. Rocky we gotta release our songs ASAP I'm turn the Grammys into the Yammys Trav we gotta drop the track with me you and Uzi this week bro. Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooo\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 I leave my emojis bart Simpson color I'm used to the heat of independent thoughts yes I said we. We the people like my brother Q Tip said on the final Tribe album that should have won the Grammy when we become president we have to change the name of the plane from Air Force one to Yeezy force one \u261d\ufe0f the Charlamagne interview just got an offer on 10 million. Yo @cthagod should we hold off for a hundred million??? Jay Virgil Obama Trump and Mental Health.  Just a few things that were discussed. Charlamagne the new Oprah adidas have been great partners and they've let Yeezy be Yeezy.  This could've never happened at Nike the Yeezy 700 is adidas most requested shoe the desert rat 500 sold 250 thousand in one hour on Coachella weekend.  Please do not try to play Yeezy or anyone who wears Yeezy. We are the future. the Yeezy 350s sell 400 thousand pair in four hours. Only thing close to this is the iPhone. let\u2019s be like water \ud83d\ude02 oh and Ebro I love you.

Watch how you speak my name. You would love a pair of Yeezys.  Don't play yourself. Harvey Levin of TMZ your hearing from your future president. Let's be friends. Please never use the word erratic to describe a person who is economically and psychologically empowered I follow the shade room.  Please never try to play Ye. I am this generations Ford Hughes Jobs Disney We will reach the prices I've promised there's been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts. Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap. I am currently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan. We have 160 positions to fill by the end of the year. Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year. It is the 2nd fastest growing company in history. It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn. yes I got rid of my last lawyer why? Because he wouldn't come to work full time. I also asked my last manager to come work full time for Yeezy of course the last lawyer and manager said no. So now I hired a CEO and a CFO and i have two full time lawyers as of now. I'm nobody's \"client\" I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed spread love 2024 never a master. Always a student. to be great is to be misunderstood dragon \ud83d\udc09 energy \nNatural born leaders\nVery instinctive \nGreat foresight you can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it. If your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your vision I\u2019ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn\u2019t even think to do everyone should be their own biggest fan even Prince once had an access pass life is more exciting than the movies Donald Glover is a free thinker I feel like im 18 year old again when I make beats for Nas new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons. we're evolving at warp speed This is the funnest car I\u2019ve ever driven I'm super chaaaaaarged.  Bout to take this whole thing to mars I heard these are really good for the environment \ud83d\ude4f I really love my Tesla. I'm in the future. Thank you Elon. Nas June 15th I'm hand producing all the albums I tweeted about. Been chopping samples from the sunken place \ud83d\ude02Pusha May 25th My album June 1st me and Cudi June 8th and Teyana June 22nd and oh yeah... practice pure love It\u2019s no more baring people because they have different ideas. self victimization is a disease there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus We live in a time where people don\u2019t respect people for being themselves Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized The psychological zombie effect Demonization has metastasized the blinders are off question everything The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve get past the past be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think. live in love not in fear I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f to fear God makes no sense \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f only free thinkers I love the way Candace Owens thinks the world is our office Yeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming style is genderless strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty. iterations of ideas are how culture evolves. sharing is community holding information is capitalism images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined I don\u2019t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it\u2019s actually most dangerous for the people at the top. all you have to be is yourself I need a water proof silk nylon as soon as possible. people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype we need to Aman Giri the world the beauty is in the imperfection(s) Pusha T May 25th Teyana Taylor June 22nd it's called Kids See Ghost. That's the name of our group me and Cudi album June 8th June 1st my album is 7 songs it's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them to we're all servants today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better. if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them. truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth don't trade your authenticity for approval let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation. I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere \ud83d\ude02 Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both. Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator. I will work on this \"book\" when I feel it. When We sit still in the mornings We get hit with so many ideas and so many things We want to express. When I read this tweet to myself I didn't like how much I used the word I so I changed the I's to We's. oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".  Parents are our first acting coaches. in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel. You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie. trend is always late be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear. Fear often causes people to be manipulative everything you do in life stems from either fear or love Sometimes you have to get rid of everything distraction is the enemy of vision try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas You have to protect your ability to create at all cost As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and  friends Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness RT @jack: Welcome back @kanyewest! https://t.co/TJPcPiCEJv RT @UncleRUSH: Police sensitivity training ,diversity initiatives,  body cameras for police     and a fucking arrest.
