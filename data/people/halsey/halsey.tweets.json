Again, love you! deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations. I am however, unsurprised that they weren\u2019t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come. CHERRY! EASY! https://t.co/efq1Z50Ejl I love you guys too! https://t.co/8MP980sDoT congrats to the nominees. so much great music nominated this year. definitely see a lot of my friends and colleagues missing from the nom lists, but the music speaks! this is how it goes every year right? my fans \ud83d\udc95 please do not waste your anger or frustration. i see a lot of you are upset. of course im sad too. none of it matters. literally none of it. you\u2019re here. im here. + everything is gonna stay exactly the same and without me is still a super tight, record breaking song \ud83c\udf1f well good morning. I love you. \ud83d\udc97 i bought this hat on amazon and i didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t for grown ups. https://t.co/ByglS08rPR pregnancy is a super sensitive subject. some celebrities are open about having any struggles with reproductive health. some are not. either way it seems really inappropriate to target someone and speculate about something so precious and personal. Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It\u2019s pancakes. Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten. Still love pancakes. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 @madeon \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 yes. https://t.co/DDzoH7S0e4 It\u2019s that time of year again.

My dog will be in the other side of the house minding his own business. n then as soon as I shut my bedroom door he comes RUNNING and whining like \u201cARE YOU SERIOUS? UR GONNA SHUT THE DOOR WHEN I DIDNT EVEN WANNA COME IN THERE ANYWAY?\u201d That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say on that for now. You shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear of protecting yourself from the people who are supposed to be on your side. And most young, wide eyed artists, don\u2019t have the foresight to think they will need to. And it\u2019s sad they would ever need to.. artist trust labels. It\u2019s supposed to be a healthy symbiosis. You have holidays with these people. dinners. deaths. Watch babies be born. They watch your lowest lows and highest highs. Sometimes things are unspoken. Legal doesn\u2019t mean moral or ethical. Ps. My first radio play, charting records, and extended play were all seen independent as well before I found a home at my label. I know both sides of this very well. https://t.co/EKeG2G6Q2A Hey man. Good for you. But you don\u2019t become Taylor Swift that way. It takes an army. Everyone wants a different career and a different path, 100% But insinuating she should have known or done better to reach her magnitude is negligent. https://t.co/2viXU8NRGu @jennarosee I\u2019m telling her to stop making it seem like Taylor put herself in this position and could have known / done better ???

Watching our own government be immune to our experience, and the social temperature regarding abortion is another fatal failure for humanity. This is deadly. Assigning felonies to people who seek abortion is a means to assure that those with that autonomy are stripped of their right to vote. And therefore perpetuates the cycle. i\u2019ve always been open about my struggle with reproductive health and pregnancy. what happens to the body that I live in, that you live, is nobody else\u2019s choice. i\u2019m working on a long form video on up subject, but can\u2019t just keep my mouth shut till it\u2019s finished. watching the demise of our reproductive rights sends a sickening rage through my core. autonomy is the basis of our humanity. the ability to feel and the right to choose. can\u2019t. it speaks for itself. \ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/caybDAH79T all cowboy-ed out. gonna take off my makeup and make some ginger tea and listen to NIGHTMARE 100 times love u bye xo https://t.co/q3KEnfDvxn RT @cedricjoshuaa: C\u2019MON LITTLE LADY GIVE US A SMILE.

Haha please talk to your doctors!!!! Love you guys! \u2764\ufe0f @shilooooh @visitkingdoms You are completely correct that was a mistype. Most of the people I have talked to about the experience are Cis women and that was entirely my mistake ! @autumnrebeccaaa A laparoscopic surgery! They take a camera and put it through your belly button and 2-4 small incisions on your waist line and go look for endometriosis cells in your uterus and abdomen! They are blue you can see them! Haha @visitkingdoms The insertion causes cramps for a few days but I think it\u2019s been largely over exaggerated. Once again it\u2019s different for everyone. I think medical anxiety causes a lot of the tension because most women get by with an Advil the first day. But some it\u2019s different! @bronas_jothers @isabelleprimave I never even feel it! It doesn\u2019t bother me at all, and the initial pain of insertion was a small price to pay in exchange for managing the debilitating pain endometriosis causes. my IUD helps me get on stage every night I love it! @halseycvlt @isabelleprimave Well I have a reproductive illness so it\u2019s the best option for me but everyone is different! @devilsheadlight @isabelleprimave Yeah I take a daily pill for endo pain in combination with my IUD but no matter the dosage, I can\u2019t really control if my hormones give me my cycle or break through bleeding lol @shilooooh @isabelleprimave It\u2019s different for everyone. I didn\u2019t get it the first year and now it\u2019s back. @isabelleprimave wow we are getting really personal on the time line. Lol.

Really just 22 when I wrote it and not good at figuring the whole thing out just yet :) @ShadowTodd I think I describe my poor choice of partners. Partner A. Alcoholic who calls me a bitch. Partner B. Wanted me to put my career aside to cater to him. Partner C. Addicted to drugs. Partner D. Wanted something casual not indicative of love. Better analysis maybe ;) @badlandmermaids I was doing CHARITY U SMARTASSRS Me on Halloween eating my shake shack burger after all the pics of my Poison Ivy costume had been taken. https://t.co/gQkfsIZbco pls stop I\u2019m cry https://t.co/gZl8Z84vie Fuck typo lol when I stand onstage I become a void. a void for you to scream your insecurities and griefs and triumphs and vindication\u2019s directly at/into and I absorb it all and feed rigorously off the connection. you help me understand myself. You guys are literally the sole purpose of my existence. Everything I do, eat, think, exercise, write, watch, draw is with the intention of becoming better. So I can continue to create experiences in which I feel so very, very connected to you. Thank you. Sorry for spamming your timelines. I just really love being onstage and I get kinda down when I have off time. Playing for you guys is my purpose and without it I get a lil low. Thanks for the little pick me up. I love you more than you can imagine. I really think about this show a lot. Like a lot.

I\u2019m a human built out of your voices, laughter + tears. You built me into an artist who is so lovingly attached to every one of you. I see the \u201clightning in your eyes\u201d when the first few notes of Roman Holiday play. The vindication when Control begins. Your voices carrying the chorus of New Americana. Your lights in the sky for Drive. You guys made Badlands special. There are b sides on that album PLATINUM bc u picked the songs that spoke to you + didn\u2019t need some campaign to tell u. You make creating a setlist near impossible bc every song is a \u201cfan fav\u201d. You wrote your own story into the fabric of that album Badlands Air was pretty legendary! We created an entire fake airline and had people go to an actual fake travel agency to pick up fake boarding passes / passports to enter an album release concert at a secret location? the attention to detail TRULY jumped out \u2708\ufe0f\u2708\ufe0f\u2708\ufe0f https://t.co/Nhkzf7V5Co Haha a bunch of awkward/cute shit very similar to the first day we met.
