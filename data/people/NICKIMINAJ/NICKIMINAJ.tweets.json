Sending love to my sister @TRINArockstarr during this time of the devastating loss of her beloved mother. Pls lift her up. This is a very difficult time for her. RT @theestallion: Wow hot girl summer hit a million views in less than 5 hours keep running it up \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd RT @mvnajes: The new segment is called #btchyouthought LMFAOOO https://t.co/14xNnoGrIn \ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/gVdxoMsRgl https://t.co/lZrrAc5DJH #HotGirlSummer RT @TheEllenShow: #HotGirlSummer https://t.co/XlyILmE76T But I first had to learn how to love MYSELF. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe if you wouldn\u2019t let a man treat your mother, your sister or best friend like that b/c you LOVE them, then you wouldn\u2019t let a man treat YOU like that b/c you love YOU. This isn\u2019t about judging. We judge too much. Lift them up. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe I remember being so afraid to speak cuz I never knew when that person would be in a particular mood and I could maybe say one wrong thing that would get me hit. So the diff you see in me now is that feeling when a woman feels lifted up, safe, appreciated &amp; unconditionally loved. I rlly used to think love had to hurt. So I could never look down on anyone else. We are merely human. It\u2019s not easy to leave. Especially in the world of IG where all ppl want to do is post relationship goal pics for clout &amp; attention. A man should make you feel safe, not afraid Dear all of you beautiful souls. \n\nA man who loves you does not: \n\n1. Humiliate you on social media\n2. Beat you \n3. Cheat on you \n4. Call you out of your name/put you down to lower your self esteem due to his own insecurities. \n5. Hide his phone, passwords, where abouts, etc. When u see a woman in a toxic relationship, rather than laugh &amp; say mean things, try to offer sound advice from your heart &amp; root for her to learn her worth. We\u2019ve all been there. I saw my parents fight &amp; argue non stop &amp; never divorce, so I thought this was normal behavior... That\u2019s a Makk Fakk https://t.co/HxcwKVYvgP Ok boos don\u2019t trend that dumb hashtag.
