It would be kind of nice to have real time background music playing in your life just so that you know what kind of phase you are going through your life. Anxiety is like being set on fire and trying to be calm about it while waiting for someone to put it out. But everyone around you is like, \u201cWhat fire? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Periods are the only annoying thing that you wouldn\u2019t want to go away unexpectedly. Being an adult is realizing that $500 is a lot of money to owe and very little money to own.. When you realise you overthink you overthink about overthinking only to overthink even more. Single missing socks reincarnate as Tupperware lids. As an adult, sometimes being uninvited from events is more exciting than being invited to them. Life is basically being put inside a body and personality you did not choose and having to be in the constant pursuit of happiness until you die. Anxiety is your brain running worst-care-scenario simulations. Excitement is your brain running best-case-scenario simulations. A child eating a cake in the middle of the night is having a great time. An adult eating a cake in the middle of the night is having a terrible time. Lasers were once the biggest scientific breakthrough in history, but now we use them to play with cats. If 1 human year is 7 dog years then leaving for an 8 hour work shift is like leaving for 56 dog hours, no wonder they missed us so much.

If, by law, everyone had to work for one year in the customer service industry in their lifetime, the world would be a much more tolerable place.

You\u2019re probably in a random memory of someone\u2019s childhood. There\u2019s a major chance that you\u2019re apart of someone\u2019s favorite memory and you don\u2019t even know it. No matter how hard you try not to, you are are going to bite your tongue again, and it will hurt. Getting in shape sucks but being in shape is awesome. Getting fat is awesome but being fat sucks. How many miles have I\ufe0f scrolled with my Thumb?

Anxiety is like being set on fire and trying to be calm about it while waiting for someone to put it out. But everyone around you is like, \u201cWhat fire? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Being an adult is realising that $500 is a lot of money to owe and very little money to own.. When you realise you overthink you overthink about overthinking only to overthink even more. Someone had a crush on you, was totally secretly in love with you, dreamed at you at night and you have no idea. If we worked 4 days a week and had 3 day weekends, the quality of human life would increase drastically, while also probably not affecting work production. It\u2019s funny how people quickly lose trust when searching a TV remote. \u201cAre you sitting on the remote?\u201d.. No.. \u201cGet up\u201d. Dreams are just non-canon episodes of your life. Next generation, there will be a whole bunch of parents that understand that it is impossible to pause an online game. Nothing is really lost until your mom can\u2019t find it. You never realise you took being alone for granted until you get stuck talking to someone who won\u2019t shut the f**k up. Money may not buy you happiness, but it does buy you a better quality of misery. Law students take years to learn all the laws, but as a civilian you\u2019re just expected to know and obey then all.

If 1 human year is 7 dog years then leaving for an 8 hour work shift is like leaving for 56 dog hours, no wonder they missed us so much.

The best types of people are the ones who tell you they\u2019re listening, when the rest of the group seems to have stopped paying attention. It\u2019s interesting how the human body can give birth to other human bodies, but cannot regenerate organs or critical body parts for itself.

It is weird how you can feel that your thoughts are physically located in your head. SPOiLER: \u2018Growing up\u2019 never happens. We just get larger, gain life experience (f**k up, a lot), and at some point have to pretend we know wtf is going on. Becoming an adult is like driving a bus blindfolded with every passenger telling you different directions. Being a Millenial is like joining a game of Monopoly when every property already has a hotel on it. People always complain about having to get up early for the school bus, but nobody thinks about how early the bus driver has to get up. Your future self may be thinking about you at this very moment in time. One day, you will either wake up and never go to sleep again, or go to sleep and never wake up again. The walls of hospitals have heard more sincere prayers than the walls of churches. Having a cat is a lot like having a college roommate. Most of the time you each do your own thing, but occasionally you hang out. Also, they sometimes try to eat your food and throw up in your laundry.

No woman wearing a dress with pockets will fail to mention that it has pockets upon receiving a compliment on said dress. You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home. You don\u2019t realize how long a minute is until you start doing planks. You also don\u2019t realize how fast a minute is until you\u2019re waiting for your next set. Sleep is the body\u2019s best safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours. You and your skeleton are the same age, but it will be around a lot longer than you will. The generation complaining about millennials not working are the ones not hiring them. Adulthood is like losing your mom in the grocery store for the rest of your life. The only thing separating you from certain death at 65mph is a painted white line and a mutual agreement to not play bumper cars. Elders feel disrespected when you don\u2019t let them disrespect you. There is no physical evidence to say that today is Thursday, we all just have to trust that someone has kept count since the first one ever. You realise you're getting older when the main characters aren't your age anymore. \"LMNOP\" is the rap section of the alphabet. When someone accuses you of being lazy, it\u2019s almost always because you aren\u2019t doing something they want you to do; so it\u2019s a shaming tactic rather than constructive criticism. It would be cool to have a movie shot by 2 directors and 2 versions released showing the protagonists and antagonists story. Admitting that you are wrong is the same as acknowledging that you learned something. Sometimes being a known as a \u201cgood kid\u201d growing up meant you weren\u2019t very good at being a kid. There are people out there you haven\u2019t met yet who will love you. When everyone has a self driving car, advertisers will pay for your car to choose a route that goes by their stores. We spend 20 years of our life learning, to work for next 40 years so that we can afford to live out the next 20 years. The most unrealistic part of any superhero show is the part where the super hero can hold down a 9-5 job, stay out late, and function properly on almost no sleep. Anxiety is like worrying that you forgot your car keys even though you\u2019re driving your car. It\u2019s that time of year where you figure out if it was seasonal or regular depression. Having a large vocabulary is like having a lot of crayons. You rarely use azure or ochre, but it still feels nice to have them in the box. If getting hurt physically can leave you walking with a limp, getting hurt emotionally probably leaves you thinking with a limp. Millennials were told not to talk to strangers as children, and as a result, we don\u2019t. People who leave their shopping carts in the parking spaces are probably the same people who feel the need to comment how they don\u2019t like a post. Paying rent is just like hitting the snooze button on being homeless. Honey is totally underrated. Its the only natural food that\u2019s made without destroying any kind of life. It\u2019s also the only food that won\u2019t rot. Socially anxious people often have good senses of humour because the best way to exit a conversation is to walk away during laughter. You may do something for the last time in your life today. Sleep is amazing, it\u2019s like getting a free trial of being dead every night. It would be so cool if dogs lived as long as humans, and if as a child you picked a puppy as a companion for the rest of your life. As a kid, a weekend with no plans is like torture. As an adult, a weekend with no plans feels like winning the lottery. There is nothing better than realising, right after you wake up, that you won\u2019t have to face repercussions for the terrible choices you made in your dream. It\u2019s a possibility that you may have died in your sleep, but woke up in alternate universe where you didn\u2019t. Life is just a really complicated exam, in which most people fail by copying from others, not realising that everyone has a different question paper.

Few things in life are as nice as flipping your pillow over to the cold side. Being \u201cthat guy people can go to about problems they\u2019re having\u201d is like being the only barber in town. You cut everyone else\u2019s hair, but there\u2019s no one to cut yours. The best murder weapon would be a Tupperware lid because nobody would ever find it. Maybe plants are really farming us, giving us oxygen until we eventually expire and turn into mulch which they can consume. Even depressed people are unsure of what to say to other depressed people. Straight people aren\u2019t attracted to ALL members of the opposite sex. Gay people aren\u2019t attracted to ALL members of the same sex. Everyone is just beauty-sexual, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Harry Potter was a trust fund jock who married his high school sweetheart and became a cop. People who say \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy friendship\u201d aren\u2019t considering you can buy a dog. Genuinely kind people have often been through a lot of horrible shit. They\u2019re so kind because they understand that every person they talk to might be smack dab in the middle of some horrible shit. The phrases \u201c you do you\u201d and \u201c go fu*k yourself\u201d are basically saying the same, but have very different connotations. Nothing says \"this is someone else's problem\" quite like a leaf blower. You don\u2019t think of teenagers as being creative problem solvers until you watch them create and execute a plan to get alcohol. Foxes are cat software running on dog hardware. Most kids today will never have to face the awkwardness of calling a girl at home and having her dad answer the phone. We really take for granted that both our legs grow at the same time and at the same rate. We give rude elderly people the benefit of the doubt because they've been through a lot, but there's a decent chance that old person has been an as*hole their whole life. Gay guys are really considerate. Not only do they leave more girls for us but they take another guy with them. It\u2019s amazing that society thinks much more highly of you if your shirt has an extra flap of fabric folded off the neck. Any fact about yourself that you've never told to anyone is technically one of the unknown secrets of the universe. Your age in years is how many times you\u2019ve circled the Sun, but your age in months is how many times the Moon has circled you. If you made $10,000 an HOUR, it would take you almost 50 years of 40 hour work weeks to make $1 Billion (gross income). As a kid, you hate naps but adults make you. As an adult, you'd love to take a nap but no one will let you. People who can get their point across without cursing are a dying breed. Chocolate is a flavour of milk, and milk is a flavour of chocolate. I watched my dog chase his tail for 10 minutes and thought \u201cWow, dogs are so easily entertained\u201d. Then I realized I just watched my dog chase his tail for 10 minutes. I flirt by looking at a girl and hoping she\u2019ll be braver than I am. Biting your tongue while eating is a perfect example of how you can still screw up, even with decades of experience. 2010-2014 and 2015-2019 feel like 2 different decades. For depressed people, sleep is the fast forward button for life. People don\u2019t really want to go back to a time when the world was simpler. They want to go back to a time when they didn\u2019t understand how complicated the world has always been. The most crushing feeling is when someone smiles at you on the street and you don\u2019t react fast enough to smile back. When you're in a bad mood, every bump on a road feels like a personal attack. In our lifetime, the person we have the most conversations with is ourselves, in our own head, without saying a single word aloud. If you are ever down about yourself, just remember that you have the same amount of superpowers as Batman. If Snow White married Jon Snow she would be Snow Snow. The sentence \u201cAre you as bored as I am \u201d can be said backwards and still make sense. We've built such a complex society that most people don't know how to live in it. People often get dressed up nice and perfumed, to attract someone to get naked and sweaty with. We live in a age where we have to prove to machines that we are not machines. 2019 will be last year of our lifes with \"teen\" in it. You\u2019ve probably rejected someone, who another person dreamed of dating. Waking up in the morning sometimes feels like resuming a shitty movie you decided to quit watching. Nothing makes you question your existence faster then when an automatic door doesn\u2019t open for you. Privacy is being able to watch porn with the sound on. Millennials are known as the generation where everyone got a trophy for participating, but no one points out the parents that kicked and screamed when their kids didn\u2019t get a trophy. When you meet new people in real life, you unlock more characters for your dream world. If everything goes smoothly, you probably won't remember today. Aladdin's only friends were a carpet that moved, a smoking lamp and a monkey that he communicated with. He was totally just on drugs. Boys will STAY boys if we do not teach them to be accountable men. EAT becomes FAT if you don\u2019t draw the line. It is very likely that over your life you briefly interacted with a person who is absolutely perfect for you but neither of you realized it. Nobody hates Mondays. Just a lot of people hate their jobs. My parents taught me to be kind and humble, honest and hardworking, and to save an unnecessary f*ckton of plastic bags under the sink. College is viewed as a necessity, yet priced as a luxury. The reason why shows like Friends and The Office are so beloved is because they show us what we truly want in life - a tight knit social group that we're always a part of, no matter how bad we screw up. All this technology and we still can\u2019t copy and paste from a pdf. Underwear is weird. I am currently wearing, underneath my pants, a smaller, secret pair of pants that only I know what they look like. If you\u2019re one of those public speakers that say \u201cGoodmorning\u2026.Oh come on we can do better than that, GOODMORNING\u201d I automatically do not like you from that moment on. At 29, I realised today that sweatbands on your wrists are to wipe your forehead not because your wrists get really sweaty. We get angry when the person we're talking to doesn't follow the script we gave them in our head. Looking for a job is about convincing a bunch of Mr. Krabs that you're a Spongebob when you're actually a Patrick, until you slowly become Squidward. Do you ever just crave to someone\u2019s presence, like you would literally be happy sitting next to them in silence and appreciating their existence. People who run out of shampoo and conditioner at the same time must really have their shit together. It is weird how the same people who once played a main or side character in your life can suddenly become mere surprise guests. Somebody somewhere hates you so much because of how someone described you to them. If money wasn\u2019t a so prevalent factor in the equation of life, more people would do what they truly love and it would make Earth an overall better place to live in. Parents worry about what their sons download and worry about what their daughters upload. No one says \u201cwith all due respect\u201d unless they know they\u2019re about to deliver an epic smack down. If you count, your lips don't touch until you reach 1 million. Falling back asleep is easiest when it\u2019s time to get up. Doing nothing all day seems nice until you\u2019ve actually done nothing all day and then wish you had. As a kid, the thought of living in a huge house was magical. As an adult, the thought of living in a huge house causes anxiety about the cleaning required. The internet isn\u2019t full of stupid people. The WORLD is. The internet is just the proof. Sleeping is best enjoyed in an ice cold room with plenty of blankets. All dogs go to heaven, even though they don\u2019t go to a doggy church or worship a doggy deity. They go because they\u2019re good, and that\u2019s enough. If electric eels went extinct 1000 years ago we'd probably think they were just folklore. The main reason it becomes \u201charder\u201d to make new friends as you get older is that you get really good at spotting red flags in people you meet. We try to go to bed early, so we can wake up early, to get to work early. We try to leave work early if we can, so we can make dinner early, all so we can die early from stress related diseases. Maybe late isn't so bad. Imagine how amazing a rave in an Ikea would be, like a giant house party in all the fake rooms. Somehow it\u2019s socially acceptable to put another person\u2019s genitals in your mouth, but eat ONE Skittle off the floor and you\u2019re \u201cgross\u201d. A stranger will remember you years from now because of some throwaway line you used in a brief conversation, and probably tells that story multiple times in his/her lifetime about you. But you\u2019ll never know that. When you have to study, tidying up the house suddenly becomes the best decision you took in your life. You will never know what memories you lost. The only two satisfying ways to eat popcorn is like a horse or like a lizard. Somewhere, there\u2019s a person who recalls something brave or wise that you said or did and thinks of you as someone who really has their shit together. Imagine a fish coming into your living room wearing a mask and watching you eat breakfast. That\u2019s what snorkeling is to them you sick weirdo. Social anxiety is basically conspiracy theories about yourself. Being a Millenial is like joining a game of Monopoly when every property already has a hotel on it. Older music wasn\u2019t better the bad stuff just wasn\u2019t remembered. Need to get new shampoo. The worst moment ever is when you realise that you\u2019re the one who was wrong in the middle of an argument. Your future self may be thinking about you at this very moment in time. Your dog has no idea that they\u2019re the main reason for the walk. People who voluntarily take parenting classes are not the people who need to take parenting classes. Maybe the Mayan world-ending prediction in 2012 was more of a suggestion. If Apple ever made a car they would probably have oddly sized/shaped cup holders just so people would buy their custom drink containers. When you\u2019re in 1st Grade, 6th Graders looked like adults. Then when you\u2019re in 7th Grade, seniors look like adults. Then you\u2019re a senior and you realise you\u2019re still a kid. One day, you will either wake up and never go to sleep again, or go to sleep and never wake up again. High school is basically like a free trial on education and once you graduate they ask for $50,000 if you want to continue. 3 AM is \u201ca late night\u201d. 5 AM is an \u201cearly morning\u201d. 4 AM is where you just stare at the clock and try to categorise it but you can\u2019t. Going to the movies alone is considered odd when it\u2019s actually the perfect activity to do alone. If your friends tell you not to give in to peer pressure and you don\u2019t, technically, you did. It's crazy how you can be the same age as someone, but at a completely different stage in your life. A therapy dog is essentially just a regular dog who passed a program and has an \u201cOfficial Good Boy\u201d license. Giving a hug and receiving a hug are two completely different feelings. Sleeping in your own bed after being gone for a while is one of the most satisfying things in the world. No woman wearing a dress with pockets will fail to mention that it has pockets upon receiving a compliment on said dress. Being an adult is like carrying a huge ball of laundry, you think you\u2019ve got everything under control until you look back and see all of your socks scattered across the floor. We're lucky we can't control and be productive in our dreams, otherwise our culture would have us studying/working 20 hours a day. Microwaves and humans both say \"mmmm\" when you give them food. It's hard to let someone know that they're bad at taking criticism. You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home. Your body knows how to do almost everything you learn in biology class about the human body, it just doesn't tell you. If someone is cheating on their significant other to be with you, they will have no problem with cheating on you. We miss the nineties so much because that was the last decade before the rise of social media and cellphones. Since then, our lives have been spent online and they seem to move faster and faster every year. No matter how synchronised synchronised swimmers are, they\u2019ll never be as synchronised as someone that keeps unlocking the car door for you to get in and you keep pulling the handle at the same time. The Powerpuff girls get their power from Chemical X, as in the X Chromosome. Their power is girl power. You don\u2019t realize how long a minute is until you start doing planks. You also don\u2019t realize how fast a minute is until you\u2019re waiting for your next set. Sleep is the body\u2019s best safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours. You can accidentally make a human being but you can\u2019t accidentally bake a cake. The generation complaining about millennials not working are the ones not hiring them. If humans didn't have 10 fingers there's a good chance we wouldn't use base 10 for our numbering system. As a kid a wiggling tooth is exciting. As an adult a wiggling tooth is terrifying. If we do live in a simulation, maybe magic did exist during the dark ages, but it was patched out by the devs. If a pet has stayed with you their full life, then from their point of view you have always existed and will always exist. If we successfully colonize Mars, then Earth will have its first true competitor for Miss Universe. So many heroes would have been dead if the villain just did less talking. \"Noted\" is the respectful corporate version of \"Whatever\" Your current partner will be either the most important person at your wedding or not even present.

There is no physical evidence to say that today is Friday, we all just have to trust that someone has kept count since the first one ever. Sheet music is just a sound recipe. Adulthood is like losing your mom in the grocery store for the rest of your life. The only thing separating you from certain death at 65mph is a painted white line and a mutual agreement to not play bumper cars. When someone accuses you of being lazy, it\u2019s almost always because you aren\u2019t doing something they want you to do; so it\u2019s a shaming tactic rather than constructive criticism. It would be cool to have a movie shot by 2 directors and 2 versions released showing the protagonists and antagonists story. Admitting that you are wrong is the same as acknowledging that you learned something. Sometimes being a known as a \u201cgood kid\u201d growing up meant you weren\u2019t very good at being a kid. Maybe ghosts DO exist, but they\u2019re all out exploring jungles or mountains, instead of haunting people in boring houses. Sex between a man and a woman usually involves the woman doing everything she can to orgasm while the man does everything he can to not orgasm. If chickens are ever able to tell the story of their species, humans are gonna look like the most evil villains in history. When the person you\u2019re dating asks \u201cWhat are we?\u201d it\u2019s like the free trial period has expired and you have to decide whether or not to get a subscription. A person that does something dumb becomes cute if you like them. There are people out there you haven\u2019t met yet who will love you. We would all be happier if we believed the good things people say about us instead of the bad things we think about ourselves. As an adult, truly realising that \u201cyou can do whatever you want\u201d is the most inspiring and terrifying thing in the world. We spend 20 years of our life learning, to work for next 40 years so that we can afford to live out the next 20 years. The most unrealistic part of any superhero show is the part where the super hero can hold down a 9-5 job, stay out late, and function properly on almost no sleep. Sleep is such a weird concept. You lie there with your eyes closed doing nothing, then all of the sudden your mind just stops, but you have no memory of when this happens when you wake up.. Procrastinating is just enjoying all of the side quests of life while delaying the real mission at hand. Maybe crickets have the exact opposite sense of humor to us, so whenever you hear crickets after a bad joke it\u2019s just your tiny fan club absolutely dying with laughter. Working in groups in school was never meant to teach you teamwork. It was meant to teach you the incompetence of your co-workers. You can turn your ordinary sofa into a sofa bed simply by forgetting your wife\u2019s birthday. As a kid you think adults are these very serious people, then you grow up and realise everyone's just a big kid trapped in a system. We don't teach kids how to learn, we teach them how to pass. An onion is the bass player of food. You would probably not enjoy it solo, but you\u2019d miss it if it wasn\u2019t there. You never realize just how well you can impersonate yourself until you're struggling with depression. Clothes that are not dirty enough to go to the laundry but not quite clean for the closet, go to the chair. Friends are like bananas. If you peel their skin and eat them, they die. If humans suddenly lost the ability to tell lies, the world would be in flames in a matter of hours. There is nothing more relaxing than going to bed at night and knowing that your schedule is free the next day. If you get a girl home and she\u2019s wearing matching underwear, it wasn't your idea to have sex. If you go to jail for tax evasion, you\u2019re living off taxes because you didn\u2019t pay taxes. Peoples mental state would be a lot different if they remembered all the times they made people laugh instead of all the times they failed. Your younger self is your older version. Depression feels like being tired of a long days work even though you\u2019ve been home doing nothing. The biggest injustice in this miserable life is the fact that exhaustion stacks up but sleep doesn't. People are more depressed now because they can do nothing and still be able to survived. Back in the day they had no other choice to do something in order to survive. Lack of purpose is a big factor in happiness. Somebody heard snoring and thought, \"Yeah, that's the letter Z.\" Humans invented machines to skip some effort and now go to gym to make up for the skipped effort. We humans are weird. We run everywhere in video games because we're too lazy to walk, but In real life we walk everywhere because we're too lazy to run. The reason Ouija boards say \u201cDon\u2019t play alone.\u201d is because if you did, nothing would happen. Punishment for honesty is what makes us lie. Depression is like wanting to go home but already being there. You spend your entire life waiting for something. You're always free to do whatever you want until you're told you're not. Isn\u2019t it weird how we basically have an endless mental conversation with ourselves.

There is no sleep as comfortable as the sleep you shouldn\u2019t be sleeping. Men tell their daughters and sisters not to talk to strangers but get upset when women who don\u2019t know them don\u2019t want to talk to them. I get more motivated by the phrase \u201cF**k it\u201d than any other motivational phrase The word \"quiet\" is often said very loud.

Buying used silverware doesn't seem pleasant but using restaurant silverware that has been used hundreds of times by different people seems completely fine and normal. Sucking on a hard candy until it completely dissolves without chewing it is an incredible feat of self control. We spend obscene amounts of money on vehicles and makes sure they have the features and comforts we want, only to drive aggressively and speed home to get out of it as fast as possible. Thor could have also gone for the thumb in infinity war, because he can't snap without a thumb. Life is just a really long story about how you died. They should stop selling razors by gender and start selling them by which part of the body you are shaving. i.e. Groin razors, face razors, leg razors.

No adult is ever going to ask me what my third favourite dinosaur is. If someone else has an awkward moment, I\u2019ll forget about it almost immediately. But if I have an awkward moment, I think about it constantly for years. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel their kids owe them something. The kid didn\u2019t bring itself into this crazy world. Being depressed when you otherwise have a nice life feels a lot the same like having a full pack of cigarettes and no lighter. My adult years have made me question why anyone would go big when they could go home. A \"lap\" is a non-existent body part that imaginably exists only when you are sitting. We don\u2019t give enough credit to our ancestors for figuring out what we can and cannot eat safely. They are the real heroes. Everybody wants you to work hard, but nobody wants to hear about how hard you work. We should have a holiday like the Purge, but instead of killing people customer service employees are allowed to say whatever they want to customers. If Jon Snow is turned into a white walker, does he become Jonny Walker or Snow White? I definitely would go slightly out of my way to step on a crunchy looking leaf. If you marry the right person, for the rest of your life you\u2019ll be \u201cdoing what you love.\u201d Websites telling me I\u2019m using adblocker is a bit like a vampire at the window: \u201cI notice you\u2019ve got your windows locked\u2026\u201d I hope after I die I get to see my stats like, number of breaths taken, number of good deeds, number of house flies killed with my bare hands. The world has become so competitive now. If you share your troubles with someone, they start sharing their own to prove that your troubles are nothing compared to theirs, instead of just sympathizing. Attractive people probably think that everyone is a lot more friendly than they really are. Your funeral is the one thing you will attend and miss simultaneously. No wonder cats and dogs hate each other. One wags their tail when they're excited, the other when annoyed. It's all a huge misunderstanding. Buying erasers is literally paying for your mistakes. Demanding respect because you are older is a form of participation trophy. Everybody is gangsta until the cockroach starts flying. Somewhere someone on this earth needs a person just like you in their life, and they\u2019re always wishing for you to show up. \u201cSurviving high school\u201d now has a whole new meaning. You don\u2019t realise what a terrible singer you are until you\u2019re singing at the top of your lungs and the music suddenly stops or skips and you\u2019re forced to listen to yourself carrying a note that you have no business singing. If you suddenly realise that you're dumb, you're now less dumber than the time just before realisation. Being a baby must be traumatizing at times. Imagine going to sleep in your house and you wake up at Target. One day you\u2019ll stop being asked what you want to be when you grow up, and instead be asked what you wanted to be.

The first rule of passive aggressive club is\u2026you know what, nevermind. It\u2019s FINE. There would be a lot less babies if women had to orgasm in order to conceive. It\u2019s so insane that no matter how weird your dream is, they seem completely normal when you\u2019re in them. Like, you could be riding a giant chicken and it\u2019d be totally normal. The reason why moms always know where everything is is because they're the ones moving our things all the time. People spend billions on movies about saving the world but no one spends billions on real life saving the world. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up richer. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up poorer. Meeting new people is great because you haven\u2019t done/said anything cringy around them yet. Sleeping is the only way to not feel pain or depression. Driving the speed limit on a 1-lane road may be the easiest way to make enemies without doing anything wrong. Minty is just cold spicy. Smarter people are more depressed because they see how the world really is, not what it is made out to be. For a procrastinator, deadlines are both the most stressful, and the most helpful thing in life. Best advice you can get going into adulthood is don\u2019t trust anyone who talks down to janitors, trashmen, maids etc. What idiot named it hereditary depression instead of blue genes.

The only thing that makes being human tolerable is going into a dark room, curling up into fetal position, and being unconscious for 8 hours a day.

The only thing that\u2019s worse than being ignored by the other gender is being ignored by automatic door sensors. If you think about it we're all wet on the inside. True love is finding that special person you are comfortable exposing 95% of your true self to, and it doesn\u2019t result in catastrophe. Ever wonder if the bank just looks through your account and think what the f**k is this person doing. The worst part about being a kid is always being told what to do. The worst part about becoming an adult is not being told what to do. After honey was first discovered, there was likely a period where people were taste testing any available slime from insects. In 500 years a young archeologist is going to find someones preserved sketch book with crazy monsters, dark horror beings and evil Garfield sketches and spend his whole career trying to prove their existence. Not having to set an alarm on the weekends feels so great even though you're going to wake up at the same time anyways.

We\u2019re lucky that our bodies require sleep, otherwise our cultures would have us working 16-20 hour days. Doing nothing all day seems nice until you\u2019ve actually done nothing all day and then wish you had. History would be the most interesting subject in school if they taught just how raunchy, and violent, History really is. Imagine a new episode of Game of Thrones every time you went to class. Adulthood is having the \"there's food at the house\" talk with yourself. Bananas are always emitting ethylene gas which makes other fruit ripen quicker, but they also grow in bunches. Each bunch of bananas is a battle royale to see who can kill the others fastest. Travel size toothpastes last way longer than they have any right to. Ironically, being a food source for humans is probably the single most effective way for an animal to ensure the perpetual survival of their species. As a kid, the thought of living in a huge house was magical. As an adult, the thought of living in a huge house causes anxiety about the cleaning required. Somewhere in the world is a tree exactly your age.
