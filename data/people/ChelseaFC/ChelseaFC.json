There will be more from him and Lampard on our website and app later today. Thank you for following. #LOSCCHE @CesarAzpi Azpi on Jorginho: 'He has impressed me a lot since he arrived. This season he has adapted to the manager who prefers him to play a bit longer, and create more chances. His work-rate has been amazing. He recovers a lot of balls, so he\u2019s a very important player for us.' #LOSCCHE @CesarAzpi Azpi says that while it's true Lille have less experience than us, they will be a force in front of their own supporters. He adds they are a very fast team who are dangerous when given space. He points out they have players with experience like former Blue Loic Remy. #LOSCCHE @CesarAzpi Azpi says as one of the experienced players he is there to help out the youngsters during their first experience of Champions League football away from home tomorrow night, and experiences such as these will make them stronger. #LOSCCHE @CesarAzpi The skipper says he isn't threatened by the possibility of Reece James replacing him in the side. 'I am here to support him the same way I support all the young lads. Hopefully he can be a very important player. We have great quality and Reece is one of them.' #LOSCCHE @CesarAzpi Cesar starts by praising the impact made by Abraham, Mount and Tomori this season: 'I have known them for a long time so I know their quality, and I was very confident they had the level to perform. What they have been doing is very good for them and the club.' #LOSCCHE Now the turn of @CesarAzpi to speak to the media in France... \ud83d\udc4a\n\n#LOSCCHE https://t.co/CcSwJWlx2A Lampard's message to the players tomorrow is that there can be no lapses in concentration as Lille have quality in their attack. The result tomorrow won't be the be all and end all but it is a game we need to be ready for. \n#LOSCCHE Lampard, asked about Kepa, says he was happy our goalie had a clean sheet at the weekend. He adds that Kepa is a focused professional and he has been impressed by him although maybe he could become a bit more vocal. But he is very happy with the player.   \n#LOSCCHE Lampard says he has a lot of trust in Fikayo Tomori but he does not see him as contesting directly for a place with Toni Rudiger alone.

I have belief in the players. I'm confident but very aware of the dangers.'\n\n#CHEVCF Frank talks about his goal against Liverpool in the Champions League, which came while he was grieving the loss of his mother, as a particularly special memory for him and one that bonded him even closer with the Chelsea fans and the club.\n\n#CHEVCF Lampard says he will be proud to make his Champions League debut as Chelsea manager tomorrow. He cites multiple incredible nights in the competition, particularly at Stamford Bridge.\n\n#CHEVCF Frank says he never had clear expectations for Tammy Abraham. 'I just believed in him and trusted him. I know a lot was made of the ban giving opportunities for young players but I felt now was his time.'\n\n#CHEVCF On Kante, Hudson-Odoi and James, Lampard says they are all fit but not match-ready just yet. He adds Callum and Reece may play in another couple of Under-23s games before returning.\n\n#CHEVCF Frank reports that Toni Rudiger is out of tomorrow's game. 'Toni is injured. He's bothered a small groin problem that he's been carrying for a few weeks and will have a scan later today.'\n\n#CHEVCF \ud83c\udf99 Let\u2019s hear from Frank Lampard ahead of #CHEVCF at the Bridge tomorrow! https://t.co/VCa7vWRpMB \u2708\ufe0f @Mateo_Kova23 https://t.co/NgnEKO1RL7 Valencia in our sights! \ud83d\udc40 https://t.co/WVaorj8Vke Training is underway for the Blues! \ud83d\udc4a https://t.co/5FUizbkM3E Back to work! \ud83d\udcbc https://t.co/2Xp1Jw608S The pass from Frank. \ud83d\udc4c\nThe finish from Ramires. \ud83d\udd25\nTruly amazing. \n\nWatch how 10-man Chelsea overcame Messi's Barcelona, in the 5th Stand app now! @ChampionsLeague @fikayotomori_ And to preview tomorrow's game, @kepa_46 will join Frank Lampard for a press conference at Cobham - and you can watch it live on our app and website. \ud83d\udc4a\n\nhttps://t.co/EW7utPhkVf The @ChampionsLeague returns tomorrow! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n#MondayMotivation https://t.co/i3JsCXRExN 'Frank Lampard has always believed in us.' https://t.co/OpUjyz7saP Let's watch it again! https://t.co/EnCFWqNHma The emotion when Brana did this! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nRelive that amazing Champions League comeback against Napoli in the 5th Stand app now!

He felt Kovacic was tired which is why Gilmour came on, and he wanted Batshuayi to bring energy up front. He adds Tammy was clearly our best player today. #CHESHU Lampard starts by saying we need to defend better as a team.

We'll have more on our website and the 5th Stand app later today.\n\n#CHELEI On N'Golo Kante's best position, Frank says: 'It was a discussion that was over-talked at times last year. We need flexibility in midfield and nobody is pinned down by a structure. He has too much in his game to sit deep all game.'\n\n#CHELEIC Frank reports that Rudiger and Willian are getting closer to fitness and are both in contention for the Leicester game. On Hudson-Odoi, he says the teenager is also getting closer and has been training with the development squad in the last week.\n\n#CHELEI Lampard: 'I'm proud to manage this club. I've been back a few times and had great support so it will be an emotional, special day for me but the important thing is that we win the game.'\n\n#CHELEI Frank is asked about the online abuse directed at Tammy Abraham this week: 'Tammy has great character. I'm disgusted by this so-called Chelsea fan's comments. Tammy was brave and he asked me to take the fifth penalty on a big night when the world was watching.'\n\n#CHELEI Lampard says Sunday's game against Leicester is a big game for us in front of our own fans. He warns that Brendan Rodgers has a good mix of experienced and young players so will be a tough opponent.\n\n#CHELEI Frank: 'There were good parts of the Man United game that got lost in the result but not lost on me. Against Liverpool, we played one of the top teams in the world and really matched them.'\n\n#CHELEI Bang on time! \ud83d\udc4a\n\nFrank Lampard has arrived for his #CHELEI press conference... https://t.co/imMqNdbI0I Tune in to the app at 1pm (UK) today to watch Frank Lampard's press conference ahead of #CHELEI! \ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udc4a Check out the new-look matchday programme for Sunday's game! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nThe programme includes more voices, more columns, more first-person pieces from the players themselves and analysis from those who work at Cobham and Stamford Bridge. \ud83d\udc4c https://t.co/zf0TzKbHju Back to the Bridge on Sunday! \ud83c\udfe1 https://t.co/P9eXeJ2Ipb .@KurtZouma: \u2018We can be proud because we played a very good game against a strong side.

We'll have more reaction on our official website and the 5th Stand app later on.\n\n#SuperCup When asked about Liverpool's extra days of rest before the game, Frank says: 'Two days more recovery this early in the season is clearly an advantage to them, although you wouldn't have known it the way we played. We didn't lose for that reason but it was frustrating.'\n\n#SuperCup On Abraham's saved spot-kick in the shootout, Frank says: 'I've told him not to worry. I've missed penalties before, anyone can miss, but what I want to see is the confidence of a young player to step up.'\n\n#SuperCup Lampard says there were good signs today from his team. He believes if they keep on playing like that and improving then we will have a good season.\n\n#SuperCup Frank praises the performance of N'Golo Kante, who was carrying a knock from the weekend. He also reports he was happy with all his players today, citing their work ethic and ability to regularly get in behind Liverpool's defence as particular positives.\n\n#SuperCup Lampard: 'My overall feeling is one of pride. I'm a terrible loser but I'm happy with the team performance because we were very unfortunate.'\n\n#SuperCup It's time to hear the thoughts of Frank Lampard after that narrow defeat...\n\n#SuperCup A performance to be proud of.\n\n#SuperCup RT @ChelseaFC: TOGETHER \ud83d\udc99\n\n#SuperCup https://t.co/tktvDDEFb3 The Blues lose 5-4 on penalties. \ud83d\ude14\n\nCongratulations to Liverpool on the win.\n\n#SuperCup Adrian saves.\n\nLIV: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\nCHE: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\u274c\n\n#SuperCup Salah scores.\n\nLIV: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\nCHE: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n#SuperCup Emerson down the middle!\n\nLIV: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\nCHE: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n#SuperCup Alexander-Arnold squeezes it past Kepa.\n\nLIV: \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\nCHE: \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n#SuperCup Nerves of steel from Mason Mount!
