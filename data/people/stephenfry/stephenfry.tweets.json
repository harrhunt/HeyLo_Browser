What an extraordinary performance from @RobCross180 - quite brilliant - farewell and thank you @PhilTaylor - #Lovethedarts How @PhilTaylor can take himself out of the moment and waste his time with silly interactions with friends in the crowd just before a crucial shot is more than I can comprehend. Imagine if he were focussed all the time ... #Lovethedarts Lordy lordy lord. Double Crossed, outscored and blown away by @RobCross180 who looks to be the future of darts. My mouth had been hanging open for the last hour and a half. Stunning. The beauty of this match is that there\u2019s no bad outcome (unless aliens land and zap everyone with acidic custard) #Lovethedarts Merciful heavens! I am not alone in my trousers.  #Lovethedarts Holy moly. This is why we love it so #Lovethedarts Wow. Simply wow. It\u2019s as if we can see the crown moving from one brow to the other #Lovethedarts In case you\u2019ve ever wondered how many dartists there are called @PhilTaylor - well, the crowd @Yourallypally are here to help You feel that @PhilTaylor needs to get what Sid called his \u201cunderstacker\u201d working from the getgo #LoveTheDarts @Philsloers @PhilTaylor They did a version certainly\u2026 I\u2019ll get sentimental here. You may know @PhilTaylor has (obviously) \u201cI got the power\u201d as his play on. But he\u2019s introduced always with Copland\u2019s \u201cFanfare For The Common Man\u201d - the right anthem for him and for darts. Nothing nobler. Sometimes people ask me, with doubt in their voices and raised eyebrows, why I #Lovethedarts \u2026watch tonight and you might get some idea. It doesn't get better than this Congratulations everyone. What a way to start 2018. What a game from @madders10 You can go for @HKane's record this year please https://t.co/cjFCm8IwSA @nycjayjay One doesn't like to rain on the @washingtonpost's parade but most of those have already been heard on BBC Radio 4's @ISIHAClue - and you'd think a leading newspaper, proud of its fact-checking, would know how to spell \"flatulence\"...

Congratulations to m'col @hughlaurie CBE \u2013 lending some lustrous class to the New Years Honours list @MikeMills86 Unbelievable. One of the great matches.... feel sad for MvG but what a result for Cross, who may look like a hard bouncer but seems a lovely guy When one year ends and another begins I often think of T. S.
