I love you all. #letlovewin Being given more words to speak... means being given more responsibility. I commend @twitter for doing their part to help us all say more, which will in turn allow us to make a bigger impact globally. #letlovewin I love my fans/followers and friends who are also committed to doing their part to make the world a better place. You are truly amazing, and every single one of you can be apart of a move towards a beautiful world. #letlovewin To every single person effected by any and every act of violence or hate or natural disaster. Please know that I am with you. Beyond my thoughts and prayers I am making a commitment that my social media platforms will be used as a tool to find governmental and social resolutions. There are so many ways we can all get involved to do our part to make the world a better place, and I'm hopeful that in the coming months and years these social media platforms that give all of us a voice to make the world a better place will enable us to do our part #letlovewin I choose to be apart of the understanding and acknowledgement that there is a real problem, and that we can be the solution. #letlovewin Next. Hate and or biased based on someone's race or background or religious beliefs or sexual orientation or identification... THIS MUST END. We are all one. #letlovewin Okay. Real talk. Let's start with mass shootings. THIS HAS TO STOP. Too many innocent lives lost. My heart breaks every time I look at the news, and see that people that showed up to pray... or go to a concert or were just fucking walking down the street were killed. #letlovewin Ah man I ran out of characters... \ud83d\ude11 I guess it'll just have to wait till I'm not limited anymore. Hey everyone. I just wanted to say I'm not afraid to over share anymore. 160 characters used to define my point of view, but now being given over 200 characters is so liberating. I feel like I should start my first 260 character post by saying everything I wanted to say before.. Craigslist Missed Connections is a truly incredible place.
