Thanks to all the love and support &amp; ENERGY all my fans gave me in reuniting our bond\u2014 had to commemorate these tour moments. Now looking forward to the next phase........\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 @LouieBanks https://t.co/OLoMxldzuA ...Because each time I was uplifted, I was energized with ability to create music that gives back. This cycle of love and friendship is what will inspire me to continue making music for you - and that\u2019s a promise. ...I am unfortunately unable to attend in person tonight, but I look forward to continuing my support of, for and with the HRC. \n\nAs I reflect on what this HRC honor means, I extend my hand to each hero who helped me throughout their own times of struggle and growth... ...how far we\u2019ve come and that my voice and presence has made an impact thus far is more fulfilling than words can express. To be acknowledged by the @HRCLosAngeles - our leaders who fight for equality - is an honor I accepted with much gratitude... ...The activists on the front lines of change have created a world for my friends to also thrive.  These forward steps would truly not be possible without the perseverance of the Human Rights Campaign. I recognize there are still so many hurdles ahead, but to realize... ...I would not have had the power to be where I am today without the return acceptance from those who, like myself, were labeled as \u2018other.\u2019\n\nWhile these social relationships leave me satisfied and fulfilled, I can\u2019t help but acknowledge the struggle to get where we are today... ...I wore piercings when society told me to be fresh faced. I kissed girls when executives told me fans would look away. I helped give attention to gay relationships and eating disorders and phobias when they were mostly taboo. What I realize is that... ...I think the reason why I connect so deeply with this community is my intense love for anyone who is grateful and passionate to be living as their true selves. I thrive in the company of other humans who are proud of individuality, authenticity and creativity... small group of people I surround myself with - fellow dancers, glam artists, and creatives who I realize are overcoming obstacles of their own - the fights for freedom, the struggles for equality, and prayers for acceptance... Since the very beginning of my career I have leaned on the LGBTQ+ community for support, friendship, joy and acceptance.

I\u2019m hearing and loving all your passion and desire for more content\u2014 I\u2019m grateful &amp; going to give back... I just want us to remember that at this point in my career I\u2019m in competition with no one but myself. This record has been about doing things on my own terms and not following a typical promotional suit. I want to do this on a more personal level for you, &amp; I\u2019m going to be giving you guys some performances of #Liberation material in my own way. #xtinaQA https://t.co/RFJizq7JPu I do have one specific routine you\u2019ve probably heard a snippet of me doing at one point or another over the years. It\u2019s out there... #xtinaQA https://t.co/cPH2GUjnHO You\u2019ll definitely hear elements of past &amp; present on this tour\u2014 don\u2019t want to give away any secrets but...

He definitely has talent there if he ever wants to do anything w/ it #xtinaQA https://t.co/XQ65bYMLzf Part of the reason behind #Liberation taking that long was a start and stop process with having my daughter &amp; my schedule with The Voice, which is no longer happening, and I am very inspired with the new direction I\u2019m going. Quite a few actually\u2014 I had recorded a lot more &amp; you may see them pop up on tour, on my socials, or even on a follow-up album... WHICH NO I\u2019M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER 6 YEARS TO RECORD #xtinaQA https://t.co/4gwIIElS0D I do love horror...I\u2019m gonna go classic on this one\u2014 during Halloween time I love to go back &amp; watch the original \u201cHalloween\u201ds (with Michael Myers.)

It\u2019s been really rewarding to be able to focus on getting back to my love of the music &amp; not the superficial grind of the machine or cheesy commercial demands that are put on us as artists. #xtinaQA https://t.co/0xUgt64T6i I enjoy experimenting with textures according to my moods, whether it be soft tones to belts and growls...
