And I find listening to words from strangers comforting. So hopefully sometimes I can be that stranger to you guys. @BreneBrown By constantly trying to change and seek perfection and a life of no pain only causes more pain I am realising. \nStill on course and learning but feeling the closest I\u2019ve ever felt to a real space of joy, gratitude and peace.

It is who you are. I\u2019ve watched and read so much over the last 6 months to try and make sense of all the mess in my head.
