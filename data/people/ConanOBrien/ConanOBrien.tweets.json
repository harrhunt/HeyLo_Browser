Now that Canada has legalized marijuana, maybe Canadians will finally mellow out. For Halloween, I\u2019m going as a newspaper.

I just tried out a new flight simulator that\u2019s so realistic, I spent the whole 2 hours grounded at JFK. I ordered the Olive Garden \u201cBottomless Salad Bowl,\u201d and it led me to Narnia. Ever since I scooped my eyes out with a melon baller, the news hasn't bothered me so much. Ugh, my dog's giving me those \"Jeff Sessions checking to see if Trump is still mad at him\" eyes again. President Trump is sounding more and more like a mob boss. At a press pool this morning, he referred to America as \u201cthis thing of ours.\u201d Today everyone is rightly praising the courage and wisdom of John McCain.

My son\u2019s back-to-school backpack has a \u201cburner phone your parents don\u2019t know about\u201d pocket. People need to stop making fun of Trump\u2019s Space Force. I am all for this administration buying ideas from my 10 year old nephew Brandon. I'm glad the media is using her full name, \"Omarosa Manigault-Newman,\" so I don't get her confused with other Omarosas. I bet even George Clooney wishes he was George Clooney. Attention Investors: Tiny, waist-high fireworks that pop softly and don't scare dogs.

I tried to cover it with a porn site, but she\u2019s fast. My kids don\u2019t believe it when I tell them how in my day, you could get an avocado toast for just $7. One thing you don't often hear: \"Hey, Dolph! No, not you, the other Dolph!\" I'm going on tour and bringing some friends with me. Pre-sale tickets for my @nycomedyfest show on 11/8 at the @BeaconTheatre are available now with code: TNYCF https://t.co/xEDTBsVAMr https://t.co/qnYQ00TbVn I\u2019m taking Intro to Fortnite at the local community college. (That\u2019s how Ninja did it, right?) I\u2019m starting a podcast about comity, it\u2019s called What The Heck. Okay, yep, that's on me, he got me good! (I just found out the recycling bin I've been using for 3 years was really @SachaBaronCohen all along.) There's going to be a movie about this whole MoviePass - nevermind it just lost funding. For the record, I don\u2019t want Rudy Giuliani doing my eulogy. I\u2019m taking comfort from the fact that those plans for making 3-D plastic guns were written by IKEA. I just got instructions for how to print a 3-D \"Pandora's Box.\" I don't know. Are we sure that was the LAST Airbender? Just got a pool floatie shaped like friends that want to come over and hang out with me. My son just came home from robotics camp. At least, I think that's him. Around the third sangria, the women catch on that nobody invited me, but by then I\u2019m off to the next book club. When I was a kid at sleep away camp, I still remember how exciting it was to get a letter from my Mom and Dad's attorney. When I grill burgers, I take a tip from the restaurant guys and, at the last minute, sprinkle in just a hint of e.coli. I thought the Shazam movie was about a superhero with the power to guess the name of any pop song. I truly hope there are people in France who believe that, in America, LeBron is known as TheBron. Just noticed the poster for Mamma Mia 2 features as many people of color as a poster of me. These are the best Spanx I've ever worn. #ConanCon https://t.co/Ar7QgoFkYR I love it here at Comic-Con. I\u2019ve got the entire Gotti panel to myself. #ConanCon I have X-ray vision, but it only works on objects wrapped in very thin tissue paper. #ConanCon At any given point during Comic-Con, San Diego is the #1 place on the planet for tights drying in hotel bathrooms. #ConanCon I got my hands on the Batgirl audition tapes. @Nick_Offerman has this one in the bag. #ConanCon https://t.co/b8ZSqBDS8q Comic-Con's the best - I've already seen a Batman, a Superman, AND a Spider-Man, all trip over a Bird scooter on the sidewalk. #ConanCon I'm a better Batman than Christian Bale and Michael Keaton combined. https://t.co/Ft8tX7YC62 I love Comic Con. Just saw Thanos arguing with hotel front desk about not getting an ocean-view room. #ConanCon I just saw two Rocket Raccoon cosplayers fighting over a Princess Leia wig! Oh wait those are real raccoons fighting over a Cinnabon. #ConanCon Is it me or is Putin riding Trump like an e-Scooter? Sure, everyone loves Chewbacca - unless you\u2019re the guy who has to keep coming over to snake out his shower drain. #ConanCon As a kid, I knew I was in trouble when my Mom would say \u201cConan Christopher O\u2019Brien\u201d through the megaphone she borrowed from the SWAT team. Song Titles (Are Cooler When Part of the Title Is In Parentheses) Every father wants to hear those precious words: \"Daddy, I won the lottery.\" Decades ago, James Brown tried to warn of our jobs being taken by sex machines, but would we listen? Elon Musk didn\u2019t save the Thai soccer team, but he will put them on a Tesla waitlist. It\u2019s so hot out I keep dunking my head into my relationship with my father. If someone ever body shames me I'm going to clap back. God, I'm lost. Musicologists now believe Beethoven wasn\u2019t really deaf, he just pretended to be to avoid hearing Schubert\u2019s boring stories about his fraternity pranks. One of these Sundays, I\u2019d like Pope Francis to say \u201cGod\u201d the way the FIFA announcer says, \u201cGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!\u201d With the kids off at camp, my wife and I finally have some precious time to check Facebook in separate rooms. After four margaritas, I call it Cuatro De Julio. In the new James Bond movie, Bond apologizes to women for his behavior and is never seen again. About to peel an orange. AMA Does it help the environment if I drink vodka out of a reusable water bottle? I\u2019d like it to be on the record that I was making \u201cPaul Rudd\u2019s penis is ant-sized\u201d jokes LONG before he ever played Ant-Man. Step on this little raised platform and I will guess your weight with astonishing accuracy. Stove Top Stuffing is my favorite side-dish that sounds like a Midwestern porn video. Don\u2019t mean to brag, but my latest colonoscopy is getting 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. One sensuous glance and I knew: she was waiting for my coffee order. I will pay for a remake of the remake of The Last Jedi, starring only corgis. Meek Mill would also be a good name for a factory that grinds up gentle folks. Is it bad that Hereditary made me feel a lot better about my childhood? No matter how bad things might seem right now, at least we still have Nick Offerman\u2019s insane giggle: https://t.co/FPy37tBjAm A little fact about me: \u201cI can hold my pee all night\u201d was my least successful pickup line. Either I was a terrible NBA coach, or my players just weren't good enough to run my patented heptadecagon offense. I just saw 3 of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons on eBay. All I want for Father's Day is for my kids to stop calling me \"Not-Dwayne-Johnson.\" I\u2019m still confident Tiffany Haddish will not reveal what I did at a party to Steve Martin. One big perk of being part of the new AT&amp;T/Time Warner family is I now have access to the exclusive FIFTH bar. There's no one I'd rather go Super Saiyan with than @RonFunches. https://t.co/w9pzicAGwp #CluelessGamer #DBLegends My goal is to be featured in a piece about celebrities called \"You'll definitely believe what they look like today\" Thank you to @ProdevHaiti and my young friends at Ecole Nouvelle Zoranje for sending me this beautiful mural. https://t.co/4LmbnRYNqL After I retire, I want to move to Vermont and confuse visitors by opening a \u201cBed OR Breakfast.\u201d Hard to believe that it used to take days, even weeks, to call someone you disagreed with \u201cHitler.\u201d Hats off to the team of puppeteers who control Rudy Giuliani\u2019s facial expressions. President Trump and Kim Jong Un reportedly have different ideas of the word \u201cdenuclearize.\u201d It\u2019s just like \u201cLaurel vs. Yanni\u201d except with the whole planet at risk. Great news, my mom just called to say Scott Pruitt bought a broken ottoman from her garage sale for $275,000.

He was a carpenter, but He didn't bring it up every time you met Him. America Ferrara had a baby. I\u2019d like to see Trump \u200b\u200bclaim that kid wasn\u2019t born in \u201cAmerica.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve enjoyed hikin\u200bg the Appalachian Trail these past 22 days with Melania Trump. I did not know that \"prison reform\" was something I could talk about with Kim Kardashian. Trump! Right? Wow. &lt;--- just RT this when applicable. There's nothing worse than people online who feel they can just command others to discuss a topic they bring up. Discuss.

My wife\u2019s new nickname for me is \u201cPrince Harry if I squint.\u201d I never get more than halfway through my sci-fi movie pitch before my therapist says, \"our time is up.\" I played #TheShow18 with fellow great athlete Aaron Judge (@TheJudge44). #CluelessGamer https://t.co/1dq02U7Egi It is a time of turmoil. It is a time of confusion. It is a time of great tidings but also of grave misgivings. It is a time of upheaval but also a time of downheaval. It is a time of tweeting while drunk on Pinot. The only thing keeping me from starting my own doomsday sex cult is that I look terrible in sunglasses. Can we make ie and ei interchangeable so that no matter what, I never misspell recieve? Doesn\u2019t every single picture of Michael Cohen look like he\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d I'm confused - if Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize, shouldn't Trump be trying to dismantle the entire Peace Prize industry? Please no spoilers for 1)  #TheAmericansFX and 2) #TheAmericansUS, if you know what's going to happen to us. Did you know if you follow Rudy Giuliani on Twitter, it will suggest you also follow several twitter accounts promoting rabies awareness? If Trump wins a Nobel Peace Prize, I bet he\u2019ll try to trade it in for an Emmy. My Mom always says \u201chomemade gifts are the best.\u201d Hope she enjoys the meth.

I told my neighbor Greg to check out \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and now I see it's breaking box office records so YOU'RE WELCOME, MARVEL.

I save money on cheese by only trapping mice in a prison of their tortured memories. Alexa, stop watching me shower. I\u2019m looking for a pill that gives me 4 hours of drymouth, but with no risk of erections. I really, really, really want to see Donald Trump spell \u201cRudy Giuliani.\u201d Congratulations to @jaketapper on his new book @TheHellfireClub.

After three drinks, I sometimes mispronounce \u201cCharlize Theron.\u201d I just saw a cloud that looked exactly like my father withholding his approval. Last night, the portraits of Washington and Jefferson quietly snuck out of the White House. When I was a kid I thought by now we\u2019d be living on the moon and zipping around in flying cars and sleeping in the same room as your wife. After seeing how Ivanka is treated in the press, I\u2019m so grateful I decided against hiring my daughter then asking her to constantly lie for me. Trump just made his own shadow sign an NDA. My son asked if I\u2019d take him to see Sherlock Gnomes and I told him, \u201cGnome thanks.\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting for a high-five for three days now. My son pranked me early this morning with the old \u201csledgehammer to the back of the head.\u201d At this year\u2019s White House Easter Egg Roll, the winning child gets to fire the Trump Cabinet member of their choice. The new TIME cover just reminded me that all his movies are now available ON BLU-RAY! https://t.co/ZFFMsJYY5M President Trump didn't just call Roseanne to congratulate her on her sitcom. He wanted to know if she'd be next up for Secretary of State. Coming soon to theaters nowhere: \"Due Buffoni\" starring @jordanschlansky and Conan O'Brien. #ConanItaly premieres April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/AFda32H92F The only thing I don\u2019t love about those \u201cMedieval Times\u201d restaurants is how you die at age 30. I miss the rites of spring from my childhood, the snow melting, the birds chirping, me being cut from the baseball team. I\u2019m pretty sure the audience appreciated my standing up repeatedly and saying, \u201cActually, it\u2019s PANTHER OF COLOR.\u201d I took fake Italian and real CONAN employee @jordanschlansky to Italy. Watch #ConanItaly April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/1BLYO0NZDt .@JuddApatow did a beautiful job making #TheZenDiariesOfGarryShandling. It\u2019s about so much more than a great comedy mind. Watch it starting tonight @ 8pm on @HBO. I hope President Trump knows what he\u2019s doing with these tariffs. Just had two eggrolls at Panda Express and it cost me $611.00. Saying John Bolton looks like a walrus isn't fair. He looks like a muppet walrus judge. 75-year-old Joe Biden wants to fight 71-year-old Donald Trump. The winner takes on Bob Newhart. Radiohead just beat out The Cure in my March Sadness bracket. Ben Affleck\u2019s back tattoo has given me the courage to share mine: https://t.co/hFL5G8HpQY Donald Trump, Jr. has brought shame to his family name by only having one divorce. Wow, the new President of Russia looks so much like the old President! Trump has become such a divisive figure, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s ruined that hairstyle for other men. Putin is going to win re-election in a landslide. Because his opponent is going to die mysteriously in a landslide. Read the tweet above this. Now read the tweet below this. COINCIDENCE??? Sometimes I feel bad for Melania, but then I remember she once killed another model with her teeth. The chances of picking a perfect March Madness bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. Which sounds impossible, but 5 years ago those were the odds Donald Trump would be president. My new workout regimen: sumo wrestling with @KevinHart4Real. Watch us on @WhatTheFit \u2014 only on the @LOLNetwork channel on @YouTube. https://t.co/gH8blSCUIJ #WhatTheFit https://t.co/ExHR6Ag3Oa .@TheRock was born to be an action hero. I was born to be his stunt double. #RampageMovie https://t.co/5hMsVlyg0z Most people don't realize @AndyRichter has been a hologram for the last five years. President Trump has been consulting with Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment lawyer. The lawyer is a partner at the firm of \u201cNotta, Good, &amp; Sign.\u201d DID YOU KNOW: Hot Dog on a Stick was originally established as a warning to hot dogs who betray the King. My show is not on TV tonight, but you can still laugh and cry while watching the March Madness Selection Show @ 6pm ET on @TBSNetwork. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had a CHUCK-CO Wood-a-Pult 4000? \u201cMcMaster\u201d sounds like what happens when a German guy makes up an Irish name. Years ago my siblings bought me a commemorative brick outside Ford\u2019s Theatre in DC.  Suck it, all other celebrities! https://t.co/2iOtSBIvJU Happy #InternationalWomensDay. Thank you to all the women who work on my show. https://t.co/sAFSv7YECA Netflix announced it will release over 700 original TV series and movies this year. That explains their new slogan, \u201cQuantity.\u201d There\u2019s too much news now. I just found out about the new aluminum tariff from my Snapple cap. March came in like a lion and was shot by some rich a-hole. My favorite wine is a 1965 Timothee Chalamet. I told my kids that at their age I had to watch VHS tapes on school safety, and they said \u201cwhat\u2019s school safety?\u201d If bumblebees truly do communicate through dance, what are the white ones supposed to do? President Trump will be attending Evangelist Billy Graham\u2019s funeral. So apparently, Graham\u2019s being buried at a golf course. When our kids were babies, my wife and I played them Salieri instead of Mozart, and now they\u2019ve grown into jealous, brooding schemers. It\u2019s your last chance to enter to be my co-host for a night. Enter now to help me host #CONAN and support @NEXTforAUTISM @ https://t.co/x7KrfnUufj https://t.co/ZtiKcSSJ6x I was in Black Panther. Not the movie, the live sex club in Atlanta. I was asked to leave. Watch the premiere of #FinalSpace tonight @ 10:30/9:30c on @TBSNetwork followed by my interview with creator @OlanRogers. I\u2019m available to represent Hungary in the 2022 Winter Games. Just tell me the sport and I\u2019ll start taking lessons. Trump\u2019s plan to save the environment is to arm the trees with pollution. If I could play any musical instrument in the world, it would be a violin that has twenty million dollars hidden inside it. I just went to this crazy 80s retro party where we ended up invading Grenada. They should make brownies that look like joints but contain no marijuana. I can't stand wheelchairs. Damn, I messed up the punctuation on that one. It should be: \"I can't stand! Wheelchairs?\" Mike Pence just won a gold medal in his winter Olympics event, \u201cthe frozen stare.\u201d I'd say the worst example of a retailer piggybacking on a cool movie's hype is the new Macy's campaign: \"BLACK PANT(s for) HER\" Our Italian adventure is over. Ciao for now and stay tuned. #ConanItaly https://t.co/e24oi8juyR I'm not saying everyone in LA is stoned, but a cop just pulled me over to give me a high 5. Is anyone else listening to that podcast in their car, the one with the sobbing woman who says I'm not a podcast, damn it, I'm your wife, what's wrong with you? #HappyValentinesDay https://t.co/VCgad9zWlh The highlight of Carnevale in Viareggio was meeting Sardinian Captain and Mrs. Crunch. #ConanItaly https://t.co/ZLA6GZ36Ae Took @jordanschlansky to Carnevale in Viareggio. One of us had a great time. #ConanItaly https://t.co/zFGVAmQZkN Arrivederci, Florence. Time to hit the road. Andiamo! #ConanItaly https://t.co/c7KLD42Pel #NSFW #ConanItaly https://t.co/wi17tCXgYP Ciao! I just arrived in #Italy to film a new episode of #ConanWithoutBorders, and brought along a friend. It\u2019s going to be a long week. #ConanItaly https://t.co/qyznU6Ltd9 I hope the newly announced \u201cIndiana Jones 5\u201d retells the entire saga from the point of view of the snakes. I don\u2019t know how this happened but apparently I was just traded to the Cavaliers??? Still trying to figure out how Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 8-hour speech fits into the Cloverfield Universe. So you\u2019re telling me, I\u2019m the *only* person at this party who thought the \u201cB\u201d in \u201cBYOB\u201d stands for \u201cBotulism?\u201d Scientists have recreated the face of a teenage girl from 9,000 years ago. Careful analysis shows she died of embarrassment over something her mom did. I just found out my spirit animal is a therapy poodle. Boy, I sure hope Trump doesn't resign or anything. #ReversePsychology #WorthAShot What novelist do pirates love? Gearrrge Arrr Arrr Marrrtin. (For your personal apology, contact my office) I bet $1500 on the Eagles. The band. Do you think Janet Jackson\u2019s other breast feels like it didn\u2019t get its turn? In a fight between Devin Nunes and the FBI, who do I bet on? The group who took down John Gotti, or the guy who got his genitals caught in the zipper of his parachute pants? https://t.co/ohEPySRDry Amazon is starting its own healthcare company. Good for them, but I think I\u2019ll continue to get my healthcare from https://t.co/WRovOqgSJb. Late night thought: My body is a reverse Brita filter. Show your support for the people of Haiti with a \"Haiti Is Great Already\" t-shirt. Each shirt sold benefits @jphro and @artistsforpeace. https://t.co/UYjO3fKmFi #ConanHaiti This meal is delicious! (NOTE TO SELF: save this one to drafts and use it if I have a delicious meal) Hi guys. Going to be away from Twitter for a while. Just dealing with all of these Toys R Us closures in my own private way. FYI, it\u2019s *3* minutes to midnight on my Doomsday Apple Watch. Watch the first nine minutes of #ConanHaiti and tune in tonight @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/R56YYdnWY9 I just heard CBS is bringing back \"Murphy Brown\" which means I'll now have to sit my kids down and give them the \u201cMurphy Brown talk.\" Man, I\u2019d do anything to trade jobs with Riley: https://t.co/kUi2llFsXV I\u2019m excited to announce that I\u2019ve found my successor. https://t.co/k0u4BqFH4k It doesn't matter if I\u2019m \"solving a problem that doesn\u2019t exist\" - my point is that these tiny avocado pit cannons are just $49.99 apiece. We know Trump watches Fox News commercials because he just put a reverse mortgage on the White House. That\u2019s a wrap on #ConanHaiti! Thank you to the people of #Haiti for their warmth, hospitality and humor - and a special thank you to our excellent Haitian crew for making it all possible. Make sure to watch #ConanHaiti this Saturday night at 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/EeVKxZ1mIi #Haiti is truly a beautiful country. #ConanHaiti https://t.co/CfxDFvNz2i Getting the people of #Haiti to model my updated @RealDonaldTrump #Maga hat. #HaitiIsGreatAlready #ConanHaiti https://t.co/Y0RLHWyY0B Had an amazing dinner at Brasserie Quartier Latin and danced so hard to the @BoukmanEKS featuring @mikaben &amp; @paulbeaubrun that my pants fell down. I love this country. #ConanHaiti https://t.co/qsDqE8rh6j Here I am disrupting the educational process once again. #ConanHaiti #PRODEVHaiti https://t.co/gDEaI4a892 Hey @WCKitchen! Thanks for letting me help out with Haitian cuisine prep. I didn't know it was possible to flunk out of school in ten minutes. #ConanHaiti https://t.co/QLA7PihE2h Just landed in #Haiti and already made some new friends! Follow me all this weekend in real time as I explore this beautiful country. #ConanHaiti https://t.co/GGmv8mtmO9 Before I travel to Haiti, I want to introduce myself to the Haitian people. https://t.co/hCaKaQDjUC #ConanHaiti Instead of checking IDs, bars now make sure that people can\u2019t name 3 YouTube Stars. If I die suddenly, in order to avoid embarrassment to my family, I\u2019ve designated a friend to destroy my enormous hidden stash of hand-painted pewter wizards. Here's why I'm heading to Haiti later this week. https://t.co/G3BqTCVy4a #ConanHaiti If you are in Washington, D.C., an exciting time to visit the White House is 1-3PM, when they feed live lizards to Stephen Miller. Still reeling from @realDonaldTrump\u2019s very negative Yelp review of Haiti, which means I\u2019ll love it. Headed to Haiti later this week to explore and make some new friends. Stay tuned for my report. #ConanWithoutBorders In his new movie, Liam Neeson is \u201ctaken\u201d in an elderly insurance scam. I know an awesome recipe for opening soup. A) I\u2019ve never been to Richmond, VA and B)  I showed you my tattoo in confidence. https://t.co/BYLgaJtSIQ President Oprah would sit down with Kim Jong-un for at least three segments. I finally finished a Chapstick without losing it or putting it through the wash. Time to die. Funyuns: not all that fun. Discuss. In LA, I have trouble guessing how old people my age are. If you haven\u2019t yet seen the movie, \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d SPOILER ALERT: Whatever shape container you put it in. The Mega Millions drawing is going to make someone an instant Republican. It's starting to look like the Russia investigation will finally bring Trump down. And by bring down, I mean get him reelected. One thing we can expect from this fight between Donald Trump and Steve Bannon: A lot of heavy, labored breathing. Personally I'm secure about the size of my nuclear button. Still waiting for Donald Trump to be downgraded to a tropical shit storm. How many people have been wrongly charged with murder because they\u2019d just finished eating a pomegranate? 2018: what could go right? Sad! This is the spread at the Mar-a-Lago New Year's party! https://t.co/fAbMMkjQtB I can\u2019t wait until 2017 is over.  And 2018, 19, and 20. After what happened to 2017, 2018 is refusing to come out of its room. A hilarious thing to do when you're waiting too long for something is roll your eyes and say \"What IS this, the Mueller probe?\" Let me put an end to the rumors: the creature in \"The Shape of Water\" is not me in hi-def. My egg nog koi pond looks beautiful, especially with all the fish resting on the surface oh my God what have I done? Happy Holidays to those of you who celebrate holidays. #Bases #Covered I love my family's Christmas Eve tradition of gathering around the piano and telling Uncle Sean to put his pants back on. I met Santa at the Macy\u2019s in Seattle. He\u2019s now suing me for breaking his femur. #MerryChristmasEve https://t.co/IEQDP6PELg The most commonly spoken phrase this week in all homes - \"Do you have the Scotch tape?\u201d Not a good sign: the first thing on Trump's Christmas list is one of those jackets like Mussolini wore. In Seattle for Christmas and there\u2019s only one way to travel: Monorail!!! #Simpsons #HoJu https://t.co/B8xBLehBuQ Stuck on a gift for Senator Mitch McConnell? You can't go wrong with body glitter. Rich people are really going to take a bath with this new tax plan. In money. They will bathe in money. Reading about the White House while watching #TheCrown. Could they, would they, consider taking us back? Want to co-host my show for a day and get your own podium next to @AndyRichter? Visit https://t.co/lRasL5jGl9 to enter and learn more about @NEXTforAUTISM. Pro-tip: do not go Christmas caroling in a Stand Your Ground state. Here comes Santa Claus, here come Santa Claus, right down the 405 until he hits the 101 which is backed up all the way to Glendale thanks to a jack-knifed trailer. All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth dipped in gold and turned into drone remotes. If the Christmas carolers at my door are really good, I turn my red swivel chair dramatically toward them. Just received Betsy DeVos\u2019s \u201cMarry Chrissmiss\u201d card. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni\" was for many years the textbook definition of insanity. I\u2019m not sure I agree with Roy Moore\u2019s position that \u201clife begins at masturbation.\u201d Just got picked up in a self-driving Lyft. And the driver still talked my ear off. Tonight I hung out with Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum at this cool bar called Never Gonna Happen\u2019s. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter. I bet his staff tricked him with one of these https://t.co/dCNTnOGtrd Just saw @mulaney at the Orpheum in Los Angeles and I have not laughed that hard in memory. I want to grow up to be that funny someday. https://t.co/NmemTUnqoN Trump just made even more people angry -- he plans to recognize Lannisport as the capital of Westeros. I prefer that other Chinese curse, \u201cMay you live in boring times, near a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\u201d Please don\u2019t @ me, I\u2019m on a news cleanse. I just spent 3 hours trying to solve this Rubik's Cube before my son told me it's an apple. I may need a nap. Flynn pleads guilty and flips.  Finally, the 282nd sure thing to bring down the Trump Administration. A great thing about the new tax plan - if you own a race horse, you can write off its genitals as a small business. The GOP tax plan can only be read while wearing a monocle and shouting \u201cJeeves! Wipe me!\u201d Five hundred years ago, it would take months for word of a sitcom\u2019s cancellation to reach Europe. May you live in interesting times, like when your vice-president starts picking his vice-president. I returned a book to the library today and learned they really prefer it to be a book that was previously checked out of a library. The trailer for Marvel\u2019s new Avengers movie came out today, and it\u2019s starring every woman in America. Lifehack: Get a tattoo of your face on the top of your head so there's never a need to look up from your phone. A Mormon came to my door, and after a long, emotional, and persuasive pitch, I got him to start wearing longer sleeves. Latest entry in my Gratitude Journal: \"The Altoids people didn't go into the suppository business.\" Sometimes when things go bad, I only have other people to blame. I love that. I just heard the Dead Sea Scrolls at the new Bible Museum might be fake &amp; I'm now questioning the authenticity of this \"photograph\" they sold me. https://t.co/DU2b7vKJDu Trump is already tweeting that Black Friday is the most ungrateful of all the Fridays. This year, I'm breaking with tradition a little and stuffing my turkey with delusions of grandeur. Great news: scientists have bred a turkey that tastes exactly like tofurkey. President Trump didn\u2019t pardon the whole turkey, just the white meat. This week, 90% of all calls and texts are men contacting women in their past to say, \"Are we cool?\" A few months ago while in Israel, I met a man named Ofer Aloni. He shared a moving story about the loss of his daughter and a song he co-wrote about her with @thekin. It's called \"The Power to Choose Life.\" Please take a listen. https://t.co/GWiiVDCFBF Starting to think I shouldn't have ordered a hot sauce called \"Satan's Butthole.\" I gave blood today. It's more fun when it's on purpose. I like to think of myself as \u201cThe Blind Woman\u2019s Ryan Gosling.\u201d Took what I thought was a private hike with my friend @kevin_nealon. Now I see this. Sad. https://t.co/paUFp3aarg #Lineage2Revolution cinema quality graphics will make your flat screen so irrelevant, you won\u2019t even mind when I destroy it. Download @ https://t.co/nKRv6gQSyG to play on your phone. https://t.co/LHEpNVYosw #ad Fall in LA, when the trees get work done to look like they\u2019ve changed color. I\u2019m starting to think this bobblehead on my desk is nothing but a \u201cyes-man.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure those two drunk guys with knives at the end of the bar will work this out peacefully.\u201d \u2013 (Kim Jong Un/Trump Metaphor Tweet) Me, after my Uber driver asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Andy really like?\u201d https://t.co/KgokzRkagE I believe that when we die, we all become podcasts. I'm ready for the all-female reboot of America. Dumbest move of my life: taking a Lyft from NY back to LA. Toyota Yaris. Thanks to Will Ferrell and @mark_wahlberg for coming all the way to #ConanNYC to talk about Boston. https://t.co/dIAgFc9py7 I saw the most beautiful thing in Manhattan today: a Chase Bank giving birth to a litter of baby Chase Banks. #ConanNYC Honored to have President @BillClinton join me at The @ApolloTheater. #ConanNYC https://t.co/dQvrpFyQ6c Gorgeous New York City!

It's now our turn to #Stand4Heroes with the Bob Woodruff Foundation. https://t.co/PaVF2o4z9e https://t.co/OpHebaCFum I came back to NYC to tape my show at The Apollo and retrieve this bag of Cheez-Its I left on the L train last year. #ConanNYC https://t.co/YZWwN5WFnj Thanks to Harlem style icon @DapperDanHarlem for swagging me up and down. https://t.co/jUOrT89Bda #ConanNYC First day back in New York and I've already received dirty looks from 7 different police horses. #ConanNYC So glad my younger self did not know that my older self would be drinking canned water from France. A real man should know how to order whiskey: on the rocks, in a stemmed glass, and replaced with white wine. RT @jaketapper: A cool way to help wounded veterans: watch this video about our celebrity auction! https://t.co/5ejEHEWxKM https://t.co/eNJ\u2026 \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d but he goes back in time to sleep with John Connor\u2019s mom, so he can later just keep reminding John about it. This Halloween, I served tricks over treats. I will remember the beatings for the rest of my days. The next kid who knocks on my door gets a VHS copy of \"RoboCop 3.\" Pretty excited about my Halloween costume: French Maid With Intimacy Issues Due To Her Recent Breakup With Steve. Just had a nightmare that I was Justin Turners' shower drain. https://t.co/gJ02mJrYaz This year for Halloween I\u2019m giving out Canadian passports. \"Clayton Kershaw\" is the sound you make when you cough and sneeze at the same time. Watch @AaronRodgers12 and I discuss his injury and fight off feral hippos. #CluelessGamer #AssassinsCreedOrigins https://t.co/8jn6jROBUM The only way Trump will pardon the White House Thanksgiving turkey is if it promises to do the same for him in a few months. Just saw the updated Charlie Brown special where they grind up the Great Pumpkin to flavor someone\u2019s latte. It\u2019s only the fifth inning but both the Astros and the Dodgers just left early to beat the traffic. I get off on pouring good milk down the sink. https://t.co/innOdmSjOj Just got 49 flu shots for $1.99 at Costco. It\u2019s exciting that the LA Dodgers will be playing in the World Series, unless of course their pilots get picked up. We all done with artichokes?  Yeah?  Everyone?  Full consensus?  Good. I love autumn in L.A., when the leaves change on my screensaver photos. Rest easy America, I just heroically solved the Dave the Horse crisis. https://t.co/ZiG1XMy5Br This is a terrible day to be on Twitter, please log off. #evergreen Look, Steve Bannon has a good twin https://t.co/Ee3RRlTMv5 The latest trailer for The Last Jedi blew me away, but why were the first 30 seconds about car insurance? I liked Blade Runner 2049 but its view of the future was too positive. Just read another Harvey Weinstein article and now my brain wants an Altoid. Tonight on @colbertlateshow, two sex symbols talk shop. https://t.co/h8y13GgVol Backstage for my appearance on @ColbertLateShow tonight. They told me to take a photo, so I did. https://t.co/7K4mUkaiEj The White Stripes sang \"We're Going To Be Friends\" on my last \"Late Night\" show.

Will box office numbers adjust for all the men who buy Blade Runner 2049 tickets then \u201caccidentally\u201d walk into My Little Pony: The Movie? It\u2019s time Dress Barn updated their name to something cool. Like, Gown Silo. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re going to make a new Blade Runner movie every 35 years. Performed last night with the hilarious @WildHorsesShow. That face I'm making is the first sign of a massive stroke. https://t.co/5ewiX2C6BE I explored a land of moist wood, no railings, and British Orcs with @kumailn. #CluelessGamer #ShadowOfWar https://t.co/GdErFRHpO1 The most disturbing detail about Trump's new tax plan is the requirement that The Rich audibly click their heels with every million saved. I was forced to do this by those pricks in Finland. Finland if you're still reading this, I love you. https://t.co/GJtYzA0JJD Just got my flu shot. Took three nurses and a guy from the gym. I used to clear my head of the news by lying back &amp; staring at the clouds but now Trump officials keep flying through them in private jets. Now I finally get why our national anthem was written by a lawyer. Best wishes to my Jewish friends who are fasting for Yom Kippur or because they\u2019re trying to make it in Hollywood I am trying to fire my mime. It\u2019s not going well. The cops raided the nail salon in my neighborhood and discovered a better nail salon operating in the back.

Watch me take @TomCruise for a drive and blow his mind. https://t.co/1nWMttDRaB Tonight on @TBSNetwork, I unveil a revolutionary idea with @TomCruise. Yes, revolutionary. Since the word \"brink\" gets a raw deal, I'm going to use it in a positive way: I am on the brink of eating a nice fruit salad.

Thanks to the people of Israel for tolerating this creepy goy. It\u2019s sad to realize that those dancing gangs in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d could have just settled their differences through fighting.

And I want them to be a part of #ConanMexico. Learn more @ https://t.co/aCzbWkm1n4 https://t.co/P34xJVydWx In honor of Black History Month, Trump tried to have dinner with Jack Black. Remember when the President of the United States was smarter and more even-tempered than you? I can't imagine Donald Trump laughing.  Except maybe at a forest fire. Just saw @LEGOBatmanMovie.  If you can guess which villain I voice, you win nothing. https://t.co/KGAFIvwTjL Steve Bannon is \"college educated Jabba the Hutt.\u201d Every time Trump signs something, I think of how that pen he's using once dreamed of a better life: writing poetry, scratching butts, etc. America\u2019s new daily routine: check news, change pants. .@diegoluna_ Great!

Sometimes I hear voices.  Usually when I hide in your front closet and wait a while. A video game is the one place where I can physically overpower Tom Brady. https://t.co/9cjcK3CZBo #SuperBowl #CluelessGamer #ForHonor Before they battle in Sunday's #SuperBowl, Tom Brady and @DwightFreeney battle #ForHonor in #CluelessGamer. https://t.co/9cjcK3CZBo Tonight! #ForHonor #CluelessGamer with a mere 5 #NFL superstars. #SuperBowl https://t.co/arD23Z5MA4 A famous building in San Francisco used for making porn is closing.

Watch @ 11/10c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/UNvKwoYNPX Excited to have @ErinAndrews join us for #CluelessGamer. Here I am clarifying which one of us is Erin Andrews. #SuperBowl #ForHonor https://t.co/grH9b8FPwe The most underappreciated job in the White House is the assistant who reminds Mike Pence to blink.

The #biggame has been decided. Watch it Thursday. https://t.co/ASkr0F3yU6 One upside to a Trump presidency is we\u2019re going to be in great shape from all this marching. What\u2019s Spanish for \u201cDon\u2019t worry, amigo, he\u2019s full of shit?\u201d Kim Jong Un wants to meet with President Trump. I smell a buddy movie! If any of you see XXX: Return of Xander Cage this weekend, could you let me know if it\u2019s as good as the novel? I\u2019m heading to Mexico City to repair US-Mexican relations. https://t.co/bYIsoDaGAj #ConanMexico If Trump builds the wall, isn\u2019t that going to trap the 3 million people who voted illegally inside the US? When I die, I want to be buried with my boots on. Specifically, my black Prada Saffiano Leather Plain-Toes. I sent @TriumphICDHQ to President Trump's Inauguration to give the event the dignity it deserved. https://t.co/6RC9mffq3u A lot of job loss is attributed to automation. In fact, today I fired my writers because for the next 4 years, jokes will write themselves. You can really sense the unease in America. No wait I\u2019m just on a moving walkway in an airport. When you march the streets shouting with people it\u2019s civil disobedience, but do it drunk by yourself &amp; it\u2019s an involuntary 72-hour hold I dreamed I was driving 100 mph on the freeway and when I woke up I was driving 100 mph on the freeway. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is expected to be the most costly in US history.  And that\u2019s not even factoring in the money. The only thing we have to fear is Gerald Fear, of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He is a serial killer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in limits\u201d is a less inspiring creed when shouted shirtless to a highway patrolman who\u2019s just pulled you over. If we all pitch in, we can fund the removal of that little Eddie Munster-ish v-shaped hair thing on Paul Ryan\u2019s forehead. If an asteroid hit the earth right now, I think a lot of us would just shrug. Reminder to my massage therapists: the less you giggle the more I tip. Bachelorette party planners: make sure to buy chocolate penises with at least 65% cocoa if you want the antioxidant benefits. Except for my tendency to screech at flying sparks, I would have made an excellent blacksmith. The only time I regret having 3 cats is fairly often. Doctor says my testosterone levels are normal. So why did I just spend 3 hours on Pinterest looking at kilims? If only there was another way to be a philanthropist. An old friend sent me this photo. If I remember correctly, we stole those plastic hats from tiny strippers. https://t.co/gyt9qNbGgb I know you\u2019re not supposed to yell \u201cFire\u201d in a theater, but since when am I not supposed to yell \u201cPooty Tang?\u201d I prefer farm-to-sink, because that\u2019s where I\u2019m standing when I eat most of my meals. Inspired by La La Land, I just sang and danced my way into a divorce. If Twitter goes down, American foreign policy will have to rely on skywriting. I\u2019ve just been booked for Chinese New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve! This time of year reminds me of that sweet day in my childhood when my uncles took me skiing. https://t.co/06T8bIe2sT How much lingerie should I buy my therapist to prove to her that I don\u2019t have boundary issues? I don\u2019t make New Year\u2019s Resolutions, I make New Year\u2019s Vague Declarations Of Semi-Intent. Feels right to ring in the New Year with a 12-foot high gingerbread AT-AT #happynewyear https://t.co/DEB1MSiUBE The bowl names are getting more corporate and obscure, I thought to myself, while watching the Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel Bowl. Let\u2019s build a time machine and Make 2016 Great Again. This Friday, my friend @RondaRousey is back in #UFC207. A mere appetizer\nbefore her fiercest challenge: https://t.co/rWKW53r1rA Carrie Fisher was funny and fearless and unabashedly human.  It's an old saying, but she was a real trouper. https://t.co/fTlfBSfaQg Prediction: Before he takes the oath of office, Trump will ask us all to sign a prenup. What a holiday treat \u2014 they\u2019re offering free egg nog samples in this Chevron station men\u2019s room. How do I handle this? I got a coupon for a back rub from my gardener. Santa knows if I\u2019ve been bad or good, so he and my browser history have a lot in common. \u2018twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring. Thank you, Terminix! Found this photo in my childhood home.  Ten minutes later, I adopted the hairstyle that would rocket me to international mid-level fame. https://t.co/UXH6ZqJBe9 Neil deGrasse Tyson: The effects of altering the Space-time continuum are unknowable.\n\nMe: I hate watching \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u201d with you. I love crossing names off my Christmas shopping list because they\u2019re no longer speaking to me. I\u2019m such a Secret Santa that you won\u2019t even know if I got you anything. Just ran into the two gentlemen who arrested me in '09 for stealing a police horse. #HappyHolidays to #Boston's Finest. https://t.co/6LZzoLiKlU .@StephenAtHome That's sweet, but those signs were hand painted by George W. Bush and NOT to be taken. Return immediately. #willprosecute At my parents' home in Brookline, MA and they have this ornament on the tree from '93. #HappyHolidays https://t.co/y8fyg3DfxR Life hack: If you run out of breadcrumbs for a recipe, turn your computer keyboard over and shake it. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. The worst trick he pulled was that \u201cGot your nose\u201d thing. Ear buds were almost called lobe chums. I\u2019m going to say we\u2019re 10 months away from a \u201cReal White House Wives of DC\u201d show. 'Tis the season for weird guys to go into Brookstone, use all the massagers, then leave without buying anything. I was so hoping that Natalie Portman\u2019s biopic \u201cJackie\u201d was about Jackie Chan. How many licks does it take to get to the center of an outdated TV commercial reference? I don\u2019t bring it up a lot, but if you just count the electoral votes, I won \u201cThe Voice\u201d last season. According to the 25th Amendment, if the President is incapacitated, the Vice President becomes the executive producer of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d When it comes to kids' hats, Norway wins. https://t.co/1TIuncH89Z My dressing room in #Oslo.

A highlight from #ConanBerlin was @Flula teaching me a drinking song that translates to \"1 More Will Fit Inside You\" https://t.co/Pi1vcnaPfn I visited a professional dominatrix in #ConanBerlin. My nipples still haven't forgiven me. https://t.co/7ILUNmar98 #ConanBerlin airs tonight at 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. It\u2019s the international incident we've all been dreading. I\u2019m live on @YouTube with @Flula Borg answering all #ConanBerlin questions in a precise and orderly fashion. https://t.co/eVoPnrXIoX Every year I ask for \u201cWorld Peace\u201d and I never get it, so fuck it, I want wireless headphones! This holiday season, give the gift that says \u201cHere is your gift.\u201d Give a candle. I walked 5K today for no reason or cause and now I feel like a selfish prick. Call me old-fashioned, but I still prefer the original mannequin challenge: 24 hours in the window of a Sears without alerting security. Update on my neighbor: The pilgrim hat on the decaying Jack O\u2019Lantern has been replaced with a Santa hat Wow, the Cleveland Browns are 0-12. On the bright side, they're still leading in the popular vote. It could be worse: Trump could be Instagramming his lunch at 3am. Just 26 more shopping days until Jimmy Buffett's birthday. I\u2019m just like you. I get up and put on my pants two legs inside the same leg, collapse to the ground, and scream for my manservant Mr. Moto. Can anyone recommend a good video game that requires zero skill and is just a yo-yo? Hey America: u up? This Black Friday, I\u2019m choosing small local businesses for my frenzied, materialistic rampage. Just said \u201cCan you please pass the gravy?\u201d My uncle responded \u201cSocialist!\u201d Is it me or does the white meat seem particularly angry this Thanksgiving? Tried to pardon my turkey and he sued me for wrongful imprisonment and defamation. I'd like to go a whole day without hearing the terms \"Orwellian\" or \"Kafka-esque.\" I'd be flattered, if the category hadn't been \"Famous and Damaged\" https://t.co/IQG4oeYVYB Just looked at the holiday edition of Oprah's Favorite Things. #26 is the rare earth element promethium. I'm at Trump Tower, about to meet about a cabinet position. Sitting between Dustin Diamond and a guy that can swallow 50 eggs. If it\u2019s any consolation to Mike Pence, I was once bitterly harangued by the cast of \u201cAnnie.\" This is exactly what VR technology was not made for. Thanks @YouTube. https://t.co/1bmUcVWOya This is the first President in American history that might egg my house. I've known @AdamSandler for years and can proudly say this might be his stupidest song yet. https://t.co/RahgRzcLD4 #HereComesTheFunnyTour The McDonald\u2019s McRib is back, and there\u2019s now an app that helps you find one.

So don\u2019t forget to glance up &amp; nod vaguely before moving on with your life. #supermoon Started my day the same way I have every day since the election: By looking out my window to make sure America\u2019s not on fire. Viral cat videos - America has never needed you more. Haven't seen this much warmth since Lord Voldemort shook hands with Bill Belichick. https://t.co/vaiP4ZsBsT Tonight I started my show with a few words about the election https://t.co/Gw22eK7VcW Congratulations to the winner of the 2016 presidential election.  You\u2019ll be receiving the cleaning bill for America\u2019s pants. I had six stiff drinks and then voted. #RockTheVote https://t.co/0EOcZPSCsC Not telling you who to vote for but ask yourself: which candidate will give a more entertaining concession speech? Tomorrow, we Americans will make history by electing our 48th white male Vice President in a row. (The previous record was 47). I\u2019m waiting for them to invent a pleasure robot that\u2019s so lifelike, it won\u2019t have sex with me. Be wary of a guy or girl who wants to be \u201cFriends with Dental Benefits.\u201d NYT says elevator \u201cdoor close\u201d buttons don\u2019t work &amp; are there to give a false sense of control. In a related story, my life has been a lie. Yes, @vancityreynolds did tell my mouth a secret, and that secret was \"You are so much hotter than @RealHughJackman\" https://t.co/h01w3UO5A7 It was an honor to sign the backstage wall at the @ApolloTheater. I wrote my name over President Obama's. #ConanNYC https://t.co/S8HoSgPZn5 I\u2019m so happy to be back on stage with my friend @RealTracyMorgan. #ConanNYC https://t.co/3pP3IcJtEm I\u2019d expected some things in New York to have changed, but this bike lane running through my hotel room feels a tad unnecessary. Just did the @ohhelloshow with @mulaney and @nickkroll.

Hey Andy, it's me, your ol' pal Conan, wishing you a happy birthday! I'm that fidgety guy that sits to your left. https://t.co/afgR0jrNES It\u2019s weird that my therapy dog has no interest in hearing about my childhood.

One time I wore my brother's t-shirt, and my dad asked if I was dressing up as his favorite child for Halloween. My best chance of catching up on all the great TV shows is a non-fatal skiing accident. The Peanuts Halloween special is adorable, right up until the point when the Great Pumpkin orders Linus to kill. I'm glad Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in Literature, but apparently the committee didn't see my searing tweet last month about Craisins. Moneysaver: Any swing is a sex swing if you have sex in it.

When I'm on the freeway I can't help but honk at the a-holes who don't like my violent, unpredictable driving. I'm a compromise conspiracy theorist.

Am I too late for a Matthew McConaughey \u201calt-right, alt-right, alt-right\u201d tweet? Now that the Olympics are over, I can get back to comparing my body to the athletes on World Series of Poker. The days are getting shorter, but do they have to compensate by acting like assholes? I\u2019m down to 1%, but that should be just enough to finish this twe Kids today learn about sex and Alexander Hamilton much sooner than I did. My wig, prosthetics, &amp; makeup artist cost $2,000, but with them I can roam the Pasadena Flea Market undisturbed, looking for porcelain hands I don\u2019t take my career for granted, which is why every April I renew my commercial crab fisherman\u2019s license. Upon death, instead of having my whole life flash before my eyes, I just want to watch Season 3 of The Sopranos again I love waking up to the sound of birds arguing with their spouses. Only three people on the entire planet have ever said: \u201cHold my Olympic medal while I trash this Brazilian gas station.\u201d Lochte, Lochte, Pants on Fochte! Turns out the proper response to \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d is NOT \u201cvia a complex network of pulleys and trusses.\u201d My stream of consciousness puts James Joyce to needlenose pliers. Would it be obnoxious if I held a press conference just to say \u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 a bitchin\u2019 summer\u201d? If you wear a visor for longer than 3 minutes, you\u2019re legally required to change your name to Trey. Never tell a newly divorced masseuse to \u201ctake your anger out on my shoulders.\u201d Summer vacation is my only chance to get away from it all and just tweet. Fiji and I used to have the same number of Olympic gold medals. Touch\u00e9, Fiji. This summer I\u2019m going to work on my memoirs: \u201cThe Fire Crotch Chronicles.\u201d If the object of tennis is to hit the ball into the net and swear a lot, I\u2019m very, very good. Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Anyway, I think you fractured my clavicle and I am going to sue. Ah, the dog days of summer. These are truly my salad days. Sunday, Monday, Happy Days. Happy Dog Salad. Ok I\u2019m drunk. I know it's wrong to generalize, but I just don't like murderers. This is right around the time of year I start calling my shorts \u201cThe Chafing Dish.\u201d Given current weather trends, a Sharknado is a distinct possibility. I always bring my baseball glove to the ballpark, just in case a falcon wants to land on my hand. I am devastated by the passing of Suzanne Wright. She and her husband Bob tirelessly nurtured my career and family. This is a terrible loss. My accountant informs me that I\u2019ve never been retweeted by @Cher Had a dream where evil space creatures intent on destroying humankind land, watch us for a few days, shrug, then take off. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, dudes wore vests. My parents won't say which of their six kids they love the best, but they have told me I finished just out of the top five. I\u2019ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that I\u2019ve got great news. The bad news is that I don\u2019t know what adjectives are. Thank you,  #SDCC.

Someday they\u2019ll ask \u201cWhere's the British guy?\u201d but so far not yet. They say the Verizon guy switched to Sprint but if you watch the commercial he mouths the words: \u201cVerizon, I\u2019m sorry, they have my family.\u201d Due to Zika concerns, I\u2019m reluctantly draining my moat. I can\u2019t wait to see the pictures that Jupiter doesn\u2019t want released. Getting asked to be Trump\u2019s running mate is the new jury duty. This tweet is just a humblebrag that I can spell \u201ccantaloupe.\u201d Mansplaining to this officer why I shouldn\u2019t get a parking ticket. She\u2019s copsplaining that I\u2019m getting one anyway. Fears of the Zika virus will probably keep me from watching the Olympic men\u2019s tennis doubles. Everyone loves the \u201cpoop emoji,\u201d but I\u2019m telling you, beneath that smile there are worlds of pain. 2016 Trump/Newt sounds like a car that\u2019s about to be recalled. I\u2019m starting to regret having Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch over for lunch. Hey Conan here, with some 4th of July grilling tips. Only hire a caterer you trust. Ok enjoy the holiday! At Costco, standing in the 10 Grills or Less line. To my fellow hikers: that noise I made when the butterfly came toward my face was a terrified shriek of delight. Scotty Moore changed the world with 6 strings that cost less than $1. He combined true genius with real humility. https://t.co/UUh8AXhUvz Can someone please pass the ketchup? (one of my 21 million followers HAS to be in this diner) I had a parrot named Brexit who died last year. His last words were, \u201cMy passing will cause a worldwide sell-off.\u201d #spooky #weird Still not sure why, at the end of my appointment, the proctologist gave me a new toothbrush. I just got body-shamed by my jeans. Really looking forward to the new Disneyland they\u2019re building on that island of plastic bottles in the Pacific. Scientists have discovered that people who forgive tend to be healthier than people who don\u2019t. This changes nothing for us, @SteveMartinToGo Twitter announced they will let advertisers target users based on the emojis they tweet. Bring it on, poop companies. If Calvin Harris can\u2019t make it work with Taylor Swift, what hope do any of us chiseled, 6\u20196\u201d DJs have? Until Mexico has White Walkers, I don\u2019t think we need a wall. People in Cleveland haven\u2019t been this happy since\u2026wait, this is the first time they\u2019re happy. To the Dads out there: today and all days, may your Dockers be wrinkle-free. \u201cOnly one more game. Thank God.\u201d \u2013 Steph Curry\u2019s mouthguard I don't know that much about professional basketball, but I know this: it's going to be the Cavs in 8. Waiting at the vet\u2019s office for my dog to get his shots. Might let the guy in the beard of wasps go ahead of me. Donald Trump is the living embodiment of an erection that lasts more than four hours. Let\u2019s get one thing clear: I never joined HYDRA.

I can\u2019t wait to see Hamilton when it comes to Los Angeles, with Young MC. Hey, sometimes your stream just bifurcates  #MalePeeTalk I wish I had a 3D print of my regrets.

Buying a decorative gourd is like saying, \u201cHere, let me throw that out for you in four months.\u201d The Taliban\u2019s new leader is said to be \u201clow-key.\u201d Which explains the Taliban\u2019s new video, \u201cDeath to Whatevs!\u201d It\u2019s tough this year.  I\u2019m worried Hillary\u2019s a liar, and I\u2019m worried Trump\u2019s not. I watch RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race to learn how to unhook a bra.

Real double standard. I've noticed that men who tell women to \"smile more\" rarely comply when politely asked to \"exist less.\" The best assemble-yourself furniture comes with a few spare screws, spare bolts, and a pint of O-positive blood. We should probably operate as if God stepped out for a bit and left us in charge \u2013 but he\u2019ll be back in August. My neighbor is blasting his meditation music, but every time I go over to say something I\u2019m filled with a deep sense of peace. Right now someone at DC Comics is saying, \u201cCrap, we\u2019re really going to have to go through with this Aqua-Man movie, aren\u2019t we?\u201d I hate it when adults try to relate to youth using slang.
