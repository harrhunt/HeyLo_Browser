Joel shows you how to tap into this favor to become all you were created to be! https://t.co/sklLEJG1nJ A bitter root produces bitter fruit. If you have a root of bitterness, it\u2019s going to contaminate your life.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"Beating Bitterness\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/GS3JR0QqcW Life is fragile. Time is too short to live bitter, offended. God knows what you didn\u2019t get. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair. Quit trying to make people pay you back. Go to God and He\u2019ll make it up to you. Every thought will tell you, \u201cYou have a reason to be bitter; it\u2019s never going to work out.\u201d Don\u2019t dwell on those lies. You wouldn\u2019t be alive unless God had something amazing in front of you. He has a purpose for you to fulfill. You have to let it go. God sees what\u2019s happening. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair, He knows who walked away, and He knows how to make it up to you.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"Beating Bitterness\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/XubrRQGRfU Sometimes life doesn\u2019t feel fair; you get more than your share of bad breaks. It\u2019s easy to get bitter and give up on your dreams. But God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it was going to keep you from your destiny. He promises He\u2019ll give you grace for every season. If you\u2019re always feeding your history, you\u2019re going to be frustrated, discouraged, guilty, bitter. Start feeding your destiny. It may be impossible to you, but it\u2019s not to our God. Start expecting His favor. Start believing that new levels are coming. Start talking like it\u2019s going to happen. Just because you don\u2019t see anything happening on the outside, doesn\u2019t mean something is not happening on the inside. You have to walk by faith and not by sight.\n\nCheck out \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/3f1UE8VFPu You may have seen His blessings in the past, but you haven\u2019t touched the surface of what He has in store. The scripture says, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen, heard, or imagined the amazing things God has for those that love Him.\u201d God is going before you right now: making crooked places straight, moving the wrong people out of the way, lining up the right people, arranging things in your favor. It would be much easier if we could see the promise on the way. If God would just let us see what He\u2019s up to, then we wouldn\u2019t doubt, but that wouldn\u2019t take faith.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/apBnihhqvL What God has in store for you is going to amaze you. The people He\u2019s going to bring across your path, the influence He\u2019s going to give you, the places He\u2019s going to take you, are far better than you can imagine. Every blessing, every healing, every breakthrough was not just designed for you; it was designed to strengthen others. If you\u2019ll tell what God has done, speak life and healing, share your skills, talents, resources, then there\u2019s no limit to how high God will take you. Don\u2019t be moved by what you don\u2019t see, by what you don\u2019t have, by who\u2019s against you. God being for you is more than the world being against you.

Turn it over to God. Do what you can, then let God take care of the rest. God wouldn\u2019t have said, \"Don\u2019t get weary in well doing,\" if He didn\u2019t know how easy it is to get tired of doing what\u2019s right.

She\u2019s a remarkable woman full of wisdom and strength. What a great mother God has blessed me with. I love her dearly. https://t.co/puVldsB6mW This should be our normal way of life, \u201cLord, thank You that it\u2019s on the way. I\u2019m looking for Your goodness, not next week, not next month, not next year. I\u2019m expecting Your favor today.\u201d Stay in the now. Live with the anticipation that it could happen today. The scripture says, \u201cDon\u2019t get weary in well doing for in due season, you will reap if you faint not.\u201d God says, if you won\u2019t get tired of doing the right thing, if you won\u2019t let what you don\u2019t see talk you out of what you know, then your due season is coming. You have to trust the process. You may not see what God is up to, but while you\u2019re waiting, things are growing, things are developing.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/YHqoaVGN9h You may have situations that look like they\u2019ll never work out. If you only consider the circumstances, you\u2019ll get discouraged and give up. Don\u2019t consider your circumstances; consider your God. Our attitude should be, \u201cI know what God promised me is still alive. I\u2019m not moved by what I feel. I\u2019m not moved by what\u2019s not working out, by how long it\u2019s been, by what hasn\u2019t improved. I know what God started in my life He will finish.\u201d When you can see it, it doesn\u2019t take much faith. The test comes when you don\u2019t see any sign of what you\u2019re believing for.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/oVH1WiEi6E Many times, before a promise comes to pass, you have to go through a season of silence where you don\u2019t see anything changing. This is when many people give up on what they\u2019re believing for. But just because you don\u2019t see anything happening doesn\u2019t mean God is not working. Let\u2019s lift people up. Show them the mercy you would want shown to you. They have enough things pushing them down. Let\u2019s be that friend that sticks with them when they don\u2019t deserve it. You have to be still and know that He is God. Worry drains your energy, steals your joy, takes your creativity. Quit thinking about the problem and start thanking God that He\u2019s working. Psalm 47 says, \u201cGod reigns over the nations.\u201d The right attitude is, \u201cGod, You don\u2019t just reign over the world, You reign over my health, You reign over my finances, You reign over my family, You reign over my enemies.\u201d The scripture says, \u201cGod is a very present help in trouble.\u201d When you\u2019re in trouble, God is right there with you. He comes into the prison, into the hospital, into the difficulty.\n\nCheck out this message now on Podcast! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/k8QpyBDwXZ Step into who God created you to be. There are talents that you haven\u2019t discovered. As you take steps of faith, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Don\u2019t bury your talent; bury your fears and release your talent. Live faith-based, not fear-based. You\u2019re not a mistake; you\u2019re not an accident. Don\u2019t let someone\u2019s lack of approval keep you from your destiny. No person can stop your destiny, no bad break, no sickness, no opposition. You\u2019re going to look back and say, \u201cWhat I thought was setting me back, was setting me up to go further than I ever dreamed.\u201d\n\nDon't miss this powerful message from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/UYQMIVzFNm You didn\u2019t get here by yourself. God was directing your steps. Behind the scenes, you couldn\u2019t see it, but He was pushing back the opposition. He was favoring you. That wasn\u2019t good luck. That was the goodness of God. Quit looking to people. Start looking to God. He controls your destiny. No person, no boss, no company can stand against Him. He determines how high you\u2019re going to go. He sees what\u2019s going on. He knows what\u2019s not fair. You may think you\u2019re too old to accomplish your dream, but it\u2019s on the way. You may think it\u2019s too late to start your business, but it\u2019s on the way. Trust His timing.\n\nBe inspired by this new message from Joel. Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/lk45JJPS5y The whole time, God is in control. He already has the solution. The mistake we make too often is that we take God off the throne and we put our problem on the throne. Stay in peace, your time is coming. Doors of opportunity are going to open. You\u2019re going to see vindication, promotion, opportunity. No one can\u2019t keep you from your purpose. Even if we let fear, insecurity, intimidation cause us to shrink back, God says, \"That\u2019s no problem for Me. Fear can\u2019t keep Me out; depression can\u2019t stop what I have for you; limited thinking can\u2019t hold Me back.\"\n\nClick here to watch Joel's newest message: https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/cc9vTgo3U8 Here\u2019s the key, you and God are a majority. What He has destined for your life will override anyone or anything trying to stop you. Even if someone is against you, they can\u2019t keep you from getting to where you\u2019re supposed to be. God knows what\u2019s in you; He knows what you\u2019re capable of. He\u2019s not going to let fear hold you back. He\u2019s not going to let the negative things people have spoken over you keep you from moving forward. It may seem like the door has closed on your dreams. Every circumstance says it\u2019s too late. You need to thank God that He\u2019s making a way when you don\u2019t see a way.  \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/GePGYCPYOy God can go around what\u2019s blocking you. He can go over who\u2019s trying to stop you. He can go through the opposition. He can move someone that\u2019s holding you back out of the way. God sees potential in you that you can\u2019t see in yourself. He\u2019s going to present you with opportunities that seem way over your head. Don\u2019t shrink back. You are well able. People can\u2019t keep you out of your purpose; obstacles can\u2019t keep you from what God has ordained for you.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/vbET11sW6k God is not just a way maker. He is the way. That\u2019s why He\u2019s called the great I AM.  \"I AM whatever you need, I AM favor, I AM breakthroughs, I AM healing, I AM abundance.\" Don\u2019t let circumstances pull you out of rest. Don\u2019t let panicked people cause you to panic. Don\u2019t focus on the size of the problem. Focus on the size of our God. He controls the universe. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. Your faith is going to turn things around. Your faith is going to bring new opportunities. Your faith is going to bring unexpected favor. Don\u2019t be discouraged by what\u2019s not fair. God sees what\u2019s happening. Keep being your best. Keep honoring Him. You\u2019re not working unto people; you\u2019re working unto God. God is going to bring to life dreams you\u2019ve given up on. Promises He put in you as a child are about to come to pass. Now, do your part and look again. Start expecting, start believing, get your hopes up.\n\nCheck out \"Look Again\" on the Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/e8B57PLraO You don\u2019t need friends that only like you for what you can do for them and not for who you are. Make a change and God will give you true friends. God didn\u2019t design you to reach a certain level and stay there. Where you are is not your final destination. God said, \u201cThe path of the righteous gets brighter and brighter.\u201d This is a new day. God is breathing in your direction right now. He\u2019s going to give you favor that you haven\u2019t had.

They handed you the baton. All their sacrifices have put us much further down the road. The way to honor their legacy is to go further, to dream big. You may have some things you don\u2019t understand, you can\u2019t figure out. Maybe you don\u2019t see an answer, but that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to see it. Don\u2019t get discouraged. God is working behind the scenes. Stir your faith up. What you\u2019ve given up on, those promises you\u2019ve let go of, those dreams you think are too far gone, start believing again.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Look Again\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/bVmAGMj6Rj What we take in through our eyes and ears gets into our subconscious mind. Be aware of what pulls you out of rest.

Who told you you\u2019re not going to accomplish that dream? Don\u2019t believe those lies. Start looking again. Start dreaming again. Start believing again. When you keep looking, you\u2019re saying, \u201cGod, I believe You\u2019ll do what You promised.

This is not the time to get discouraged; this is not the time to let circumstances talk you out of it. You\u2019re close to your breakthrough.\u201d Keep the attitude of, \u201cIt\u2019s on the way. Any moment, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Expectancy, looking for it, believing it\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s your faith being released. That\u2019s what allows God to do amazing things. You may have had some disappointments, but don\u2019t settle where you are. Don\u2019t give up on what God put in your heart. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Look Again\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nRKZwXCICy It may not have happened yet, but look again. That setback didn\u2019t cancel God\u2019s plan. It was a setup for God to take you further. What God started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. He is still going to do what He promised. As long as you think it will never work out, that\u2019s going to keep you from the new things God has in store. Start believing again. Just because it hasn\u2019t happened yet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It may feel like it\u2019s over, but God is saying, \u201cLook again. That dream you\u2019ve given up on, I\u2019m still going to bring it to pass.\u201d\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Look Again\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/lLZwa0HJRe When you\u2019re honest with God and you\u2019re bold enough to ask, get ready for God to thrust you into your destiny. God wouldn\u2019t have given you that dream if He wasn\u2019t planning to bring it to pass. Don\u2019t talk yourself out of it. Here\u2019s a key, God doesn\u2019t define you by your mistakes; He refines you by your mistakes. He uses the failures, the times we blow it, the times we go the wrong way, to do a work in us. Quit being discouraged over what didn\u2019t work out. It feels like you failed, but that\u2019s not the end of your story.  You\u2019re in a time of testing. There\u2019s something bigger God has in your future. It\u2019s not enough to just pray; you have to follow it up with expectancy. God not only heard you, but He also dispatched an angel with the answer. The moment you asked God to forgive you, He forgave you. Not only that, He doesn\u2019t remember your mistakes. Check out \"Don't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/WpSBV6234h God reigns over everything that comes into your life. He may not have sent it, but if He allowed it, He\u2019s in control. He knows how to bring good out of it. Go over your history and see how God has never left you, how He kept you from that accident, brought the right person. When you look back at your history, it will give you fuel for your destiny. God is about to do a new thing. Put on some new labels: free, whole, restored. Don't miss this powerful message, \"Don't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\" from Joel! https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/lQemtzuT12 Sometimes we love a person so much, we want something so badly, that we\u2019re trying to be God. Our part is to believe, to pray, to be a good example, but at some point, you have to say, \u201cGod, they\u2019re in Your hands. I trust You to do what only You can do.\u201d That sickness may be big, but it\u2019s no match for our God. Keep Him on the throne. Quit thinking about how big your problem is and start thinking about how big your God is. God doesn\u2019t judge you by one mistake. His calling on your life is irrevocable. You may have counted yourself out, but God has already counted you in.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cDon't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\u201d. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/BkDEpfkG5c There are things that should have stopped you, but you\u2019re still standing. You\u2019re still blessed. You\u2019re still happy. You\u2019re still victorious. The only person that can stop you is you.

Do yourself a favor; remove those labels and put on what God says about you:  \nRedeemed \nForgiven\nBlessed\nRestored\nQualified\nVictorious God is breathing in your direction. He calls you a masterpiece. If anyone calls you any different, delete it. If they make you feel any different, delete it. You may have been through disappointments, life has thrown you a curve, but you have to get your fire back. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. Your greatest days in your health, your relationships, your career, are still in front of you. You can\u2019t keep making excuses; reliving the negative. You\u2019re waiting on God, but God\u2019s waiting on you. When you move forward, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see things begin to change.

Put up a boundary and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to live in somebody else\u2019s world. I\u2019m going to run my race.\u201d What God has spoken over you will come to pass.

Thoughts will tell you all the reasons why it\u2019s not going happen: \u201cYou\u2019re too old. You come from the wrong family. You don\u2019t have the education. The obstacle is too big.\u201d None of that stops our God. He\u2019s not limited by what\u2019s limiting you.

Get your passion back and go after the destiny that belongs to you. Mediocrity is not your home, good enough is not your destiny, getting by is not where you belong. You may be there now, but that is not your permanent location. Yes, we should be content, but you shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with less than what you know God put in your heart.

If you\u2019re going to become all you were created to be, you have to keep a fire in your spirit. Instead of dwelling on all the negatives\u2014the worry, the past, the problem, the addiction\u2014start dwelling on the greatness of our God. David said, \u201cI don\u2019t look to the mountains for help; I look to the God who made the mountains.\u201d God promised He would arm you with strength for every battle. We may not know what the future holds, but we know Who holds the future. Don\u2019t miss today worried about tomorrow. Today is a gift. Too often, we\u2019re worried about something that\u2019s out of our control.  When we worry, we\u2019re making our problem our God. Put God back on the throne. Use that same energy to thank God that He\u2019s in control.

So, when you face new challenges, you can look back and say, \u201cGod, You did it for me back then. I know You\u2019ll do it for me now.\u201d Receive God\u2019s love and know that, despite your shortcomings, He\u2019s still proud of you. He still thinks you\u2019re amazing. He still calls you a masterpiece. That lifts your spirit. That gives you the strength to do better, to break chains that are holding you back. Are you letting someone get you stirred up, cause you to be bitter, discontent, jealous? Recognize what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re sowing discord into your life. Be inspired by this message from Joel. Watch it here: https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/N8dALsEGA7 Too often, we\u2019re frustrated by things that only God can change. We\u2019re worried about something that\u2019s out of our control. Take the pressure off and live from a place of rest. His yoke is easy. His burden is light. Stay in peace. God sees what\u2019s happening. He hates when a person sows discord, so you can be assured He\u2019s not going to let them succeed. The good news is you don\u2019t have to fight. It\u2019s not your battle. The scripture says, \u201cIf you walk with wise men, you will become wise.\u201d You\u2019re going to become like the people you\u2019re hanging around.

It says in Psalms, \u201cThe trap the enemy set for you, they will fall in themselves.\u201d God said, \u201cTouch not My anointed.\u201d People can make mistakes, they can have weakness and be anointed. They\u2019re still made in the image of almighty God. When you come against them, you\u2019re coming against the God who created them. Stay on God\u2019s side. He\u2019s going to protect you, promote you, vindicate you, and take you to the fullness of your destiny. Watch this new message from Joel, \"Disconnect from Discord\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/NuhGF57ABH It\u2019s easy to try to straighten out the trouble makers, get baited into conflict. That\u2019s their goal, to get you distracted, fighting battles that you\u2019re not supposed to fight. You can\u2019t stop someone from sowing discord, but you can keep it from getting in you. Stay away from those that cause division. Don\u2019t let them poison your spirit. Don\u2019t let that discord get in you.

He loves it when we\u2019re fighting in our homes, in turmoil at the office. There\u2019s no power when we\u2019re divided; the power comes when we\u2019re in unity. Dwell on what God says about you. You were created to be secure, confident, talented, healthy, happy, successful. Rise up and become who God made you to be. Run your race; be your best. You don\u2019t have to impress people; you don\u2019t have to prove anything. Take the pressure off. The reason some people don\u2019t get along with people is they don\u2019t get along with themselves. You have to be at peace with yourself before you can have peace with others. If you\u2019re hard on yourself, you\u2019ll be hard on them. You may have big obstacles, dreams that seem impossible. Hold your head up high; you\u2019re a child of the Most High God.

People may have written you off, but God doesn\u2019t write you off. When you hear those voices telling you that you\u2019ve blown it, you missed your chance, that means you\u2019re listening to the wrong voices.

You\u2019re being prepared for what God has prepared for you.

God wouldn\u2019t have put it there if He wasn\u2019t going to bring it to pass. It\u2019s easy to live uptight, frustrated, worried, but most of the things that are upsetting us, in the big picture, don\u2019t really matter. You\u2019re alive; you\u2019re healthy.

We look at things logically, but God is a supernatural God. He specializes in exceeding our expectations. What He has planned for you is bigger, more rewarding, more fulfilling than you\u2019ve dreamed. This is going to be a year where God exceeds your expectations. He\u2019s not just going to do what you\u2019re asking; He\u2019s going to exceed it! Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast. \"The God Who Exceeds Expectations\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/k6vI8JYlte God is about to do a new thing. You\u2019re asking for the possible; He\u2019s about to do the impossible. You\u2019re believing for the ordinary; God is going to do the extraordinary. He\u2019s going to take you where you\u2019ve never been. It may not be easy, but your destiny is calling. You have greatness in you. Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it; don\u2019t let circumstances convince you that you can\u2019t. People can\u2019t undo every wrong. They can\u2019t give you back the years that they hurt you. The good news is God can. He said, \u201cI will restore the years that were stolen.\u201d Too often we\u2019re looking at what people can\u2019t do, we should be looking at what God can do. You may think you\u2019re surrounded by the enemy, but the truth is the enemy is surrounded by our God. God is bigger than your opposition, greater than your sickness, more powerful than your enemies. Are you frustrated over what you don\u2019t know, by what you can\u2019t figure out?  Have a new perspective. It\u2019s okay not to have the answers. Check out \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/T4gUyfktx9 Nobody that\u2019s ever done anything great in life has done it without fear. You may feel fear, but you have to do it afraid. God knew there would be times that we wouldn\u2019t have the faith we need to reach our destiny. But God said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll just have a little bit of faith, that\u2019s all you need. Then, I\u2019ll do My part. I\u2019ll exceed your expectations.\u201d Trust Him when you don\u2019t understand; be comfortable not knowing. The scripture says, \u201cLean not to your own understanding.\u201d Don't miss \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/UNpviWC9rp Keep running your race, not looking to the left or to the right. Don\u2019t be bothered by who\u2019s not for you, who\u2019s not cheering you on, and who\u2019s not celebrating you. You\u2019ll never please everyone. Nothing you do will make you any more valuable. Nothing you achieve, nothing you overcome. You are valuable right now. You may have some things you don\u2019t understand, you don\u2019t see the answer. Don\u2019t get discouraged.  God is working behind the scenes. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\". Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/33ohRAJE6s The dreams God put in your heart and the promises He\u2019s spoken to you are not going to come to pass without opposition, delays, people trying to talk you out of it. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to have a made-up mind. You may have had some setbacks, things didn\u2019t work out, but you have to be relentless when it comes to what God put in your heart. If you let people or a delay talk you out of it, then you didn\u2019t want it bad enough. When you say, \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know how this is going to work out, but I\u2019m not going to worry. God, I trust You.\u201d He will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Click here to listen to,\"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/FFDg2aqw9x It\u2019s very freeing when you learn this principle: there are some things we\u2019re not supposed to know. That\u2019s not a lack of faith; it\u2019s just the opposite. You\u2019re taking yourself off the throne and putting God on the throne. Sometimes we think it\u2019s a lack of faith to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d We think we have to have all the answers, have it all figured out. Take the pressure off. You don\u2019t have to know; God knows. He has you in the palm of His hand. God doesn\u2019t give us all the details. One reason God doesn\u2019t show us is He knows we would talk ourselves out of it. You have to be comfortable not knowing. Tune in now to this new message from Joel, \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/qOl8MZR8fl A key to faith is trusting when you don\u2019t understand, trusting when you don\u2019t have the answers, trusting when it seems like it\u2019s just the opposite of what you were hoping. You don\u2019t have to know how, as long as you know Who. The Creator of the universe will break chains that have held you back, bring dreams to pass that seem impossible. Sometimes there is no logical reason. This is what faith is all about. You don\u2019t have to figure it out. It\u2019s okay not to know.  Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/VdXA5jxrbc When you stay in faith even when you don\u2019t have the answers, when you believe though every thought says there\u2019s no way, God will show out in your life. He\u2019ll cause you to defy the odds and go places you couldn\u2019t go on your own. We are praying for the families and people of El Paso, Texas who have been hurt by this senseless act. We stand with you and know that God will never leave you or forsake you. May you find peace and comfort in His love. People may have tried to push you down, but God is going to lift you up. They are powerless to stop God's blessing. Your job is not to try to make people like you, to try to change people\u2019s minds about you. Your job is to run your race, to be who God has called you to be. Don't worry about the critics and the naysayers. Even when we\u2019re a long way off, even when we don\u2019t have it all together, even when we\u2019re still broken, our Father comes running to embrace us. Make sure you check out \"The Love of the Father\" from @JonathanOsteen here!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xah9U1QIQY The enemy wants you to curse your future with negative words and thinking. Instead of agreeing, start prophesying victory and favor. You may have big challenges, every voice is telling you it\u2019s not going to work out, but speak the blessing not the curse. People may try to discredit you, push you down. Don\u2019t pay them any attention. They don\u2019t carry any weight. What they say cannot keep you from your destiny. They are simply a distraction. God is a good father. There\u2019s nothing He wouldn\u2019t do for you. When we were at our worst, He loved us. That\u2019s the Father\u2019s heart.

Trust Him when you\u2019re under construction. Trust Him when you\u2019re in messy places. Trust Him when you\u2019re sure it\u2019s a mistake. You\u2019ve been blessed; now be a blessing. You\u2019ve overcome that addiction; help someone else overcome. You\u2019ve been promoted; help someone else be promoted. Give away what you\u2019ve been given. When we see God as our Father, we can enter with our head held high, knowing He is rich in mercy and ready to help. \u201cThe Love of the Father\" from @JonathanOsteen will inspire you! Get it here: \nhttps://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Q30ByhYS5z Life is too short to live frustrated, upset about things that, many times, we have no control over. People have a right to have their opinion, but you have a right to ignore it. People have a right to be rude, but you have a right to stay happy. The Creator of the Universe put His blessing on you, and everything else is of no effect. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, the blessing will override the curse. It was meant to harm you, but God will use it to promote you. Prayer is just talking to God. He wants to hear the details. He wants to be involved in your life. Nothing\u2019s too small.

Do your part and get your fire back. Start taking hold of God\u2019s strength. Don\u2019t allow that weariness in. The Scripture says the things we see are only temporary, but what we hear, what God speaks to us, that\u2019s permanent. Your Heavenly Father is the one who breathed life into you. He\u2019s the one who gave you your personality, your talent, your uniqueness.

Whether or not you keep the blessing depends on what you do with the blessing. When you\u2019re always lifting people, encouraging them, making them better, then blessings are always going to come to you. God\u2019s not distant. He\u2019s not unapproachable. He\u2019s not mad at us. He\u2019s madly in love with us.

The commanded blessing on your life will override any force that\u2019s trying to hold you back. Sometimes we don\u2019t realize who we are. You may feel average and ordinary, but because of your Maker, there\u2019s something about you that makes you extremely valuable. When you see what God is up to, you\u2019ll say it was worth the wait. He\u2019s a God who exceeds expectations. Start making good decisions. Start honoring God, living with excellence and integrity. When you do this, mistakes of the past don\u2019t have to stop your destiny. It\u2019s very powerful when you can say, \u201cGod, I trust not only Your ways, but I trust Your timing.\u201d Check out \"It's Worth the Wait\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/fF55hURCVp Sometimes we\u2019re putting pressure on people to keep us fixed, keep us encouraged, keep us complimented. Let them off the hook. They\u2019re not your savior. You have a Savior. He\u2019s on the throne. Go to Him and not to people. Don\u2019t have a weak mentality; have a warrior mentality. You have to be more determined than the opposition. If you give up every time things don\u2019t go your way, you don\u2019t want it bad enough. You may not like it, but you can\u2019t bypass the process. You can\u2019t skip the waiting room and reach the fullness of your destiny. Don't miss \"It's Worth the Wait\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/8fV106jCIu Value is not based on what you do or who you know. That\u2019s all superficial. Your value comes from your Creator. Don\u2019t compare your life to other people. Run your race. God\u2019s purpose for your life is not the same as theirs. Don\u2019t look to the left or to the right. Stay focused on your calling. There\u2019s nothing you can do to make God love you any more or any less. It\u2019s a gift. Just receive it. The difference between a dream and wish is that a wish is something you just hope happens, but a dream you put actions behind. God is working. You\u2019re being prepared for what God has prepared for you. The reason it\u2019s taken longer than you thought is because it\u2019s going to be better than you thought. Click here to listen to, \"It's Worth the Wait\u201d: https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/S2n1a6q4GA The situation you\u2019re in may not be changing. Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019re changing. Patience is working. You\u2019re getting stronger, more determined. It\u2019s preparing you. There's a price to pay to get prepared. You\u2019re doing the right thing, but nothing is changing, you have the promise, but you\u2019re not making progress. Something is happening that you can\u2019t see: you\u2019re developing, you\u2019re growing. Stay faithful where you are. If you\u2019ll wait with a positive attitude, then after patience has done its work, you\u2019re going to see the promise come to pass. Tune in now to this new message from Joel, \"It's Worth the Wait\": Video: https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ \nAudio: https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/bHCjrLfws5 We think of waiting as negative; we don\u2019t like it when nothing is happening. We\u2019re interested in the destination, but God is interested in the journey. He\u2019s working on us along the way. Waiting doesn\u2019t mean that nothing is happening, that God\u2019s forgotten about us. It\u2019s all a part of the process. We can live in faith knowing that, at the right time, God will get us to where we\u2019re supposed to be. When it\u2019s your time, when God knows you\u2019re ready, what you give birth to is going to be much bigger than you think. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"It's Worth the Wait\":                       \nAudio: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/vOVqwdaOzU Sometimes, it\u2019s not happening because we\u2019re not prepared for what God has prepared. If you could see what God has in mind, you would realize you couldn\u2019t handle it right now. You need more time to develop, to grow, to gain experience. Let God make you and mold you. Stay pliable. We should be better this year than we were last year. We should be making progress. Don\u2019t let the mess become normal. You don\u2019t have to go after the blessing; go after God. Honor Him with your life, and the blessing will follow. God brought you out, not just for your sake, not just so you could shine. He brought you out so you could help somebody else shine. Go after the hurting. Go after the broken, the addicted, those that have messed up.  Go after them with something more powerful, with love, with mercy, with the goodness of God. Check out this message from Joel on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/NaJ4f2jx90 You may have some obstacles in your path, situations that are not fair, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have favor. Challenges come to us all, but favor is why you\u2019re not going to stay down. Favor causes you to rise to the top. The enemy will whisper, \u201cYou have too many flaws, too many weaknesses. You\u2019ve made too many mistakes.\u201d Just remind him, \u201cI\u2019m under construction. I may have some messy areas, but God\u2019s still working on me.\u201d There are hurting people all around, broken people that think no one cares. God rescued you; He\u2019s counting on you to rescue them. Don't miss this message from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/W0XXdWAcmv You may be in a situation where you\u2019re not being treated fairly. Don\u2019t worry; your time is coming. Circumstances may be against you, but the Most High God is for you. What God has blessed nothing can curse. When you understand this, you won\u2019t go around upset. You\u2019ll know every force that\u2019s trying to stop you is powerless to change the blessing on your life. When you speak life, chains are breaking. When you show love, strongholds are coming down. When you\u2019re merciful, compassionate, kind, you\u2019re pouring oil on the wounds. Be inspired by this message from Joel. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/0BoZKJSQ7S You\u2019ve been healed; now go help somebody else get healed. You broke that addiction; help somebody else break their addiction. God didn\u2019t heal you just so you could be well. He healed you so you could become a healer. It doesn\u2019t matter who likes you. What matters is that the Most High God likes you. He\u2019s not limited by who\u2019s against you. When He commands the blessing, all the forces of darkness cannot stop Him. God loves messy people. He loves broken people, people that are at a disadvantage. Click here to listen to this important message from Joel on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/2CjWgz6DHG There\u2019s enough judgment in our world. There\u2019s enough finding fault, criticizing. Where are the healers, the lifters, where are the people that instead of turning away from the hurting, they run to the hurting? Instead of condemning the broken, help heal the broken. Nobody is too far gone. Nobody has made too many mistakes. Sometimes all they need is one person to believe in them, one person to say I\u2019m praying for you, one person to breathe new life back into their spirit. You can run away from God, but God will never run away from you. His grace will come looking for you.  Tune in now to this message from Joel: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nHAmkWGCX0 People have enough pushing them down, pointing out their faults. You can be the one to push them up, to see the best in them, to help them get free. Other people may not see it, but underneath the dirt, the mess, the bad decisions, there\u2019s a son, there\u2019s a daughter of the Most High God. They may be bound on the outside, but on the inside, they\u2019re a person of destiny. God has freely given you mercy; now freely give it to others. God is counting on us to lift the fallen, to restore the broken, to heal the hurting.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning on his Podcast!  https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/3mREotrYDN There are people God has put in our lives, on purpose, so we can help restore them. God didn\u2019t put them there so we could judge them; He put them there so we could love them. Love heals, love restores, love lifts up. Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people; it comes from the Lord. When God is ready to promote you, no person can stop you, no bad break, no disappointment, no delay. When you\u2019ve learned how to rise above the challenges, you\u2019ll be at peace when you should be upset, you\u2019ll have a smile when you could be discouraged. You\u2019re showing God that you trust Him. The favor of God has brought you this far, and the favor of God is going to keep you going. Instead of complaining, thinking about how big your obstacles are, your attitude should be, \u201cLook how big my God is.\u201d Don\u2019t give away your joy to someone you don\u2019t even know. Don\u2019t let a stranger pull you out of rest. You\u2019re not hurting them; it\u2019s souring your day. Check out \"Take Your Seat\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/iOVxmzxYYa The problem with a \u201cone day\u201d mentality is that you\u2019ll miss what God wants to do today. God wants to give you favor right here, right now. If you want to bring a smile to God\u2019s face, if you want to make His day, start approaching Him like you know He loves you, you know He\u2019s for you, you know He\u2019s longing to be good to you. When you\u2019re an eagle, when you\u2019ve learned how to rise above the challenges, you\u2019ll be at peace when you should be upset. You\u2019re showing God that you trust Him.

What God has in store for you is going to amaze you. The people He\u2019s going to bring across your path, the influence He\u2019s going to give you, the places He\u2019s going to take you are far better than you can imagine. Jesus defeated every enemy. He\u2019s already paid the price, made the ultimate sacrifice. You\u2019re not working to get the victory; you already have the victory.

Live with expectancy. When you live out of a place of rest, all the forces of darkness cannot stop you. God has the final say. It may have been meant for your harm, but instead of being a stumbling block, God is going to turn it into a stepping-stone to take you to the next level.

There are a lot of things in life we can\u2019t change, we can\u2019t change people, but we can change our approach. We can choose to not let things upset us, not go through life worried, frustrated, discouraged. When you try to make everything happen in your own strength, God steps back. As long as you\u2019re working, He\u2019ll rest. But when you rest, God will go to work.

Take your seat. Live from a place of rest, a place of peace, a place of trust. You\u2019re not going to answer to people about what you did with your life, how you spent your time, or how you used your gifts. You\u2019re going to answer to God. Your destiny is too important to let people control you. People may have done you wrong but you\u2019re not trying to pay them back.

Yes, we\u2019ve all made mistakes, but you don\u2019t have to pay God back. The price has already been paid. Receive His forgiveness, receive His mercy. You have enough people in life against you; don\u2019t be against yourself. Don\u2019t stay focused on what you\u2019ve lost. God has a plan even for the broken pieces, the remnants, things that most people would discard. He can use them to take you where He has prepared. Your brokenness can become your breakthrough. Keep an attitude of expectancy, looking for it, believing it\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s your faith being released. That\u2019s what allows God to do amazing things.

The dreams God has put in your heart, the promises, may be taking longer than you thought. You don\u2019t see any sign of it happening. That\u2019s a test. Keep doing the right thing.

When God hears you thanking Him before the answer comes, praising Him while you\u2019re in a drought, declaring His favor when the odds are against you, He\u2019ll make things happen you could never make happen. If you talk defeat, you\u2019re going to have defeat. In the middle of the storm, you need to declare what God promised.

Instead of depending on people\u2019s approval, why don\u2019t you go to God and get your approval from Him. Instead of relying on others to encourage you, start encouraging yourself.

Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it. Take steps of faith. God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. You have a purpose; you have an assignment. There is a calling on your life, something God has ordained you to accomplish. You\u2019re not just filling up space; you\u2019re a person of destiny. When it\u2019s all said and done, what God promised will come to pass.

Your assignment is still waiting for you. New levels are still in your future. God doesn\u2019t promise something and then change His mind. He doesn\u2019t put a dream in your heart and then take it back. What He starts, He finishes. You may not see a way, but God hasn\u2019t run out of options. We think natural, but God is supernatural. He has ways we\u2019ve never thought of. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"You're Still Going to Get There\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/IBzYxkMKwQ When you\u2019re in a storm, you have to grab on to the broken pieces. That means, keep believing that you\u2019re coming out, keep declaring favor over your life, keep thanking God for His goodness. He didn\u2019t change his mind. You\u2019ve spent enough energy on the past; that\u2019s not taking you anywhere. Kiss the disappointment goodbye.  You can\u2019t embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding on to the old. Don\u2019t waste your time worrying; God\u2019s on the throne. He\u2019s promised to work out His plan for your life. His plan is better than your plan. Don\u2019t get tired of doing what\u2019s right. If you\u2019ll keep passing the test, the scripture says your due season is coming. God is not only going to bring you out, but He\u2019s going to make up for the time you thought you lost. If the enemy would have known what was going to happen, he would have left you alone. Now you can soar. Now you can take new ground.

This is not the time to get discouraged; this is the time to stir up your faith. You are closer to seeing it happen than you\u2019ve ever been. When you go through unfair situations, don\u2019t get bitter. Keep serving. Keep being faithful. Keep helping somebody else rise higher. That difficulty is not there to stop you; it\u2019s there to promote you. God can take what looks insignificant and transform it into something amazing.

You may not be able to see it at the time, but that\u2019s when you have to trust Him. God says you will rule over your enemies. You\u2019re going to rule over addiction. You\u2019re going to rule over depression, rule over anger. God is putting an end to what\u2019s been hindering you. You haven\u2019t seen, heard nor imagined what God has in store. Be inspired by this message from Joel! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/rNLgB818fD Keep expectancy in your spirit. Those things that have been holding you back for years are not your destiny. That\u2019s not how your story ends. You\u2019ve been faithful, you\u2019ve passed the test, now you\u2019re closer to seeing it happen than you\u2019ve ever been. As good as the people are in your life, there are no perfect people. There is no perfect boss, no perfect friend, no perfect neighbor, no perfect spouse. Give people room to be human.

Don\u2019t get discouraged by what you see; it\u2019s not permanent. God is about to take you higher; you\u2019re going to accomplish more than you thought possible.

Congratulations to @nikwallenda and @LijanaWallenda for completing an incredible tightrope walk across Times Square!  A true testament to their faith and determination to accomplish the dream God put in their hearts and to carry on their family\u2019s legacy.  #HighwireLIVE https://t.co/gaqkWbrvGQ Praying for peace and strength for my friends @NikWallenda and @LijanaWallenda as they tightrope across Times Square! #HighwireLIVE Faith is not always going to make sense. What God promised you is not always going to be logical. There will be a battle taking place in your mind between what you see and what you hear. The scripture says, \u201cThe things we see are temporary, but the things we can\u2019t see are eternal.\u201d Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Your Wings Are Coming\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/Y860KAyeho You weren\u2019t created to go through life struggling, lonely, addicted. God didn\u2019t breathe life into you and crown you with favor, so you could barely get by. He created you to soar, to set new standards, to take new ground, to go further than you\u2019ve imagined. In difficult times, you\u2019re going to be saying something. Don\u2019t talk about how big your challenge is. Talk about how big your God is. Need encouragement?

The Scripture says that God chose you before you could choose Him. You didn\u2019t get here on your own. Get your passion back. God didn\u2019t create you to live in a drought, constantly struggling, stuck at one level. That\u2019s not your destiny; that\u2019s temporary. Don\u2019t forget about all the prayers God answered for you. Take time to acknowledge the goodness of God in your life.

God always gives us another chance. Your mistakes don\u2019t have to cancel your destiny. That problem you think will never turn around; He\u2019s already set up the answer. It\u2019s not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you had the problem. Don\u2019t take it for granted. It didn\u2019t happen by accident; it wasn\u2019t a lucky break. It\u2019s the goodness of God. Don't miss \"Recognize God's Goodness\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/34bG0msN1H When you get in agreement with God, then you will become what He says about you. You will have what He says you have. Living guilty doesn\u2019t do anything productive; it drains you emotionally and physically wears you out. Don\u2019t fall into that trap. Don\u2019t get discouraged because where you are is much smaller than what\u2019s in your spirit.  You have to be faithful with the small before God will trust you with more. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cRecognize God's Goodness\u201d. Get it here:  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/sxhbN7fAcx God said He would give you water without rain; that means God can promote you even though you don\u2019t have the experience. God can heal you without the treatment. God can increase you beyond your paycheck, beyond your education. He\u2019s not limited to your job. He owns it all. Chains are being broken; strongholds are coming down. You are redeemed, you are restored, you are honorable, you are blameless.

You have to be your best right where you are. Stay faithful; your time is coming. Those times you were discouraged, He made a way. He provided when you didn\u2019t see how. If you\u2019re going to continue to go further, then you need to remember it is the Lord your God that has brought you this far and He is the One that\u2019s going to keep you going. He chose you to succeed; He chose you to go further than those before you. Tune in now to this new message from Joel, \"Recognize God's Goodness\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nZ401qVT2X Recognize God's goodness in your life. Remember how He led you through the desert, how you met that person, how He brought you out of that problem. It wasn\u2019t a lucky break; it was the Lord your God. When you look back over your life, you\u2019ll see the faithfulness of God, where He promoted you, protected you, healed you, favored you. Don\u2019t take it for granted. It didn\u2019t happen by accident, it wasn\u2019t a lucky break; that\u2019s the goodness of God. You\u2019ve stepped into promotion, good breaks, and opportunity because of who went before you. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast.  \"Recognize God's Goodness\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/LdtQCDORJ0 The father sets the standard. Set a high standard; that\u2019s your legacy.\u00a0More than your money, more than your success, more than your accomplishments, your values, your principals, what you stand for, that\u2019s being passed down to the next generation. Your mistakes didn\u2019t cancel God\u2019s plan. You\u2019re not that powerful. Get back in the game. God is not finished with you. Whatever you face, remind yourself that you can handle it. Your architect, the Most-High God, designed you with everything you need. He promised that you\u2019ll never face anything you can\u2019t bear. What you\u2019re believing for is not way off in the distance; it\u2019s not years down the road. It\u2019s at hand; it\u2019s close. Live with expectancy. Our architect has taken into account all the weight, all the trouble, all the bad breaks, and He\u2019s given you the strength, the courage, the fortitude to withstand. Check out \"Designed to Withstand\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kMOFvWt4UH Without being faithful and proving to God that you could be trusted, you wouldn\u2019t be ready for where He\u2019s taking you. You have to be prepared for what God has in store. The Scripture says the things we see are only temporary, but what we hear, what God speaks to us, that\u2019s permanent. If you don\u2019t face the pressure, you\u2019ll never discover who you really are. The higher you go, the more pressure there will be. Don't miss \"Designed to Withstand\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/NxWftR4GAd Quit letting small things ruin your day. These things aren\u2019t going to go away. They are tests we all have to pass. As long as you think it will never work out, that\u2019s going to keep you from the new things God has in store. Start believing again. Just because it hasn\u2019t happened yet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It may be uncomfortable, you may have to stretch, but the pressure is not going to stop you. You\u2019re going to discover abilities that you didn\u2019t know you had. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cDesigned to Withstand\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/1l9L1n2ntf As long as you\u2019re allowing circumstances to determine whether or not you\u2019re going to be happy, then you\u2019re never going to have real victory. You\u2019ve been designed to withstand the winds, designed to outlast the opposition, designed to overcome the injustice, designed to endure until the dream comes to pass. That difficulty didn\u2019t come to stay; it came to pass. Be strong and of good courage, for the Lord your God is with you. Click here to listen to, \"Designed to Withstand\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Fao1BpKX7S The scripture says, \u201cTake hold of God\u2019s strength.\u201d It will be overwhelming if you don\u2019t remind yourself that this is not a surprise to God. He wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if you couldn\u2019t bear this weight. Since He allowed it, that means you\u2019re well able. Take hold of that strength. You\u2019ll never face a situation that you weren\u2019t designed for. You\u2019ll never face pressure that will cause you to collapse, never face a problem that\u2019s too much, never face a dream where you can\u2019t handle the weight. @hovihats We encourage you to stay in faith. Our team will be praying for you. You can also post your prayer request here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK. -JOM Team God didn\u2019t miscalculate when He designed you.

There are new levels to reach, new giants to conquer, new mountains to climb, new skills to learn. Don\u2019t let it overwhelm you; let it inspire you. God will never let you face more pressure than you can handle. He won\u2019t let more weight come on you than you have the strength to bear. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Designed to Withstand\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/g2zB4el10j God has designed you with exactly what you need. You may not be able to see it, but your beams are big enough, your walls are strong enough. You can bear whatever comes your way. Living guilty and condemned doesn\u2019t bring any honor to God. Quit listening to the accusing voices and move forward with your life. The final word says, \"Your latter days will be better than your former days.\" The final word says, \"What God started in your life He will finish.\" Now get in agreement with God. God puts things in your spirit as a seed. If you discount it, say no way that could never happen, then that seed will never take root. But you don\u2019t have to figure out how it\u2019s going to happen. All you have to do is believe. People may have discouraged you, but what He promised is on the way. It may not have happened yet, but He has the final say. Check out \"God Has the Final Say\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/HIjFR4hZis When you announce it, it sets the miracle in motion. Your words have creative power. You give life to your faith by speaking it out. Yes, that obstacle is big, but you have greatness in you. You are anointed, equipped, empowered. Quit being discouraged by what you see, and start being encouraged by what you hear. Forces of darkness are being broken. Any area that you\u2019re not living in victory is not permanent; it\u2019s temporary. The final say is coming.

You have to find the twenty percent that will tell you what you can do. If you\u2019re going to see it come to pass, you have to believe what you hear in your spirit and not what you see with your eyes. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. Sometimes God will wait on purpose, not only so you will know it was His favor, but so no one will be able to deny the goodness of God in your life.  Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cGod Has the Final Say\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ndIOtELVGS You can\u2019t bring yesterday\u2019s failures into today and live a life of victory. Let it go. God\u2019s mercy is fresh every morning. There are goals God has put in you, dreams, healing, promotion, restoration. They\u2019re lying dormant. You don\u2019t see how it could happen. You could easily settle there, but those promises are still alive. Start calling them out. Will you stay in faith when God is silent?  Will you wait with a good attitude, thanking God that He has the final say when nothing is changing? Click here to listen to, \"God Has the Final Say\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Orl62UmGiK Go back to those places where you quit believing and stir your faith up. Who told you it was over? That wasn\u2019t the final word. You\u2019re about to see God show out. There\u2019s a sudden change coming. God is sovereign over your circumstances. That means God reigns over everything that you face. Not just the universe, but He reigns over the sickness. He reigns over your finances, over your children. God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. What He promised is still on the way. What God started, He\u2019s going to finish. He has the final say. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"God Has the Final Say\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/9WRJJrGX4o Don\u2019t dwell on what seems impossible. Are you spending more time thinking about the problem or the promise? Are you talking more about how big the challenge is or about how big your God is? Don\u2019t let the circumstances talk you out of what God put in your heart. It may seem too late, all the experts may tell you it\u2019s impossible, but God has the final say. When you know God has the final say, you don\u2019t live frustrated, worried, stressed. You stay in peace, knowing that nothing can stop God\u2019s plan.

Your story doesn\u2019t end in defeat; it ends in victory. Get your passion back and start believing again. Don't be moved by small things: traffic, people, disappointments, mistakes. Life is too short to let your circumstances determine your joy. If you only invest in people that are at the same level as you, you\u2019ll get stuck.

He controls the universe. Start thanking Him that things are changing in your favor.

You need people in your life that are further along than you, people that have a bigger vision, people that are more experienced. You need to be exposed to new levels so that you can go to new levels. If you\u2019re the smartest one in your group, your group is too small.

God called you an eagle; He created you to soar. Don\u2019t let a sour attitude keep you grounded. It\u2019s time to rise to new levels, to soar to new heights. Your attitude is going to determine your altitude. It will determine how high or how low you will go. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"A Fresh New Attitude\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/KLctsY56uC The one thing you can always control is your attitude. If you\u2019re not proactive, if you don\u2019t choose to have the right attitude, then the wrong attitude will show up. Keep doing the right thing, keep being good to people that are not good to you, keep smiling, keep a song of praise. That\u2019s not just being positive; that\u2019s an attitude of faith. That\u2019s what allows God to show out in your life. When you\u2019re kind, you draw people to you. When you\u2019re good-natured, opportunity will come your way. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"A Fresh New Attitude\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/GrPFNoA6Cu Get up every morning and put on a fresh new attitude. This day is a gift from God. It\u2019s filled with opportunities, new ideas, new friendships. Stay focused on the good, focused on the possibilities. If you don\u2019t keep your mind moving forward, you\u2019ll become what happened to you instead of becoming what you were created to be. You have to stir up your faith. God wouldn\u2019t have given you the dream if He had not already equipped you and empowered you. Our decisions don\u2019t just affect us; they affect our family, our children, our friends. If you don\u2019t do the right thing for yourself, at least do it for your children, do it for your family. God wouldn\u2019t have put that promise in your heart if He weren\u2019t going to bring it to pass.

Let us pray with you here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK -JOM Team When you stay in peace, that\u2019s a place of power. If you don\u2019t have peace on the inside, you won\u2019t have peace on the outside. The scripture says, \u201cHe gives us different gifts, different talents, according to our own abilities.\u201d Everybody doesn\u2019t get the same, but what He gave you is what you need to fulfill your destiny. God is saying, \u201cThat dream is not only still alive, but I\u2019m still going to bring it to pass. I\u2019m still going to show you favor. I\u2019m still going to take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own.\u201d Don't miss Joel's new Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/CjfJnARQMr The Psalmist said, \u201cIf you go to the depths of the ocean or high up in the heavens, God will be right there.\u201d You can\u2019t get away from Him. It\u2019s amazing what one kind word can do. We don\u2019t think anything about it, but to the other person, it breathes new life into their spirit. If you see this, it is FAKE. \n\nJoel Osteen Ministries never requests money for prayer.

Be inspired by Joel's new message on podcast. Get it here:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EOJKaylfyy You may have made choices that delayed things, got you off course, but you\u2019re not stuck. God has a new route, not somewhere secondary, but the best plan for your life. Start believing again; start dreaming again. Start talking like it\u2019s going to happen; start acting like it\u2019s going to happen. Start thanking God that it\u2019s on the way. You may have given up on God, but He hasn\u2019t given up on you.\nListen to this encouraging message on podcast here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/O1tDYMjg2u Your time is coming. God has not forgotten what He promised you. Your mistakes didn\u2019t cancel your destiny; people not being for you hasn\u2019t stopped His plan. Do your part; those dreams that you\u2019ve buried, you need to dig them back up. Who told you it was dead? Whatever you\u2019ve buried, I\u2019m asking you to start digging it up. People are going to stand in awe. They\u2019re going to know the blessing of God is on your life. Get this encouraging message from Joel now: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/0XcFFA9N6Q God likes to do things far and beyond what we could ever accomplish on our own. If you can reach your dreams in your own talent, your own strength, your own effort, then you don\u2019t need God. Whatever God put in your heart, go after it. Quit looking at how impossible it is, how long it\u2019s been, what you don\u2019t have. Shake off the disappointments, what didn\u2019t work out, who left you. You have greatness in you. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to my amazing mom @DodieOsteen.  Today marks the 60th anniversary since @lakewoodchurch was founded by my mother and father, Pastors John and Dodie. God continues to do more than we could ask or think. Thank you for your love and support throughout the years! https://t.co/7ko5fjVOUN The people that stay happy, that don\u2019t fall into discouragement, are the people that rule over their thoughts, the people that keep their hopes up, the people that know God is still on the throne. Too often we\u2019re striving to make things happen, discouraged because it\u2019s taking too long. God is saying, \u201cCome to Me. Ask Me for help. Call on My name and acknowledge Me as your Source.\u201d The process may be uncomfortable, but the purpose is worth it. If you could see where God is going to take you, the favor, the influence, the abundance, the health, the friends, you wouldn\u2019t complain about what you\u2019re going through. God wants us to depend on Him. He wants us to see Him as the Source, to recognize His goodness.  Check out \"God Is Your Source\" on Podcast here:  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/OhmdZ0lPEs Your destiny is too great to waste it with people that are not adding value to your life. You need to pull up some weeds. Get rid of some thorns. Their negativity is contaminating your soil. You won\u2019t run and not be weary if you\u2019re focused on your problems. What causes your strength to be renewed is when you live with expectancy and have hope that God is working in your life. You have to trust God. He can see things you can\u2019t see. He knows what\u2019s best. It\u2019s all a part of His plan to get you prepared, developed, stronger. God knows what you\u2019re going to need. God says restoration is coming, new beginnings are coming, breakthroughs are coming, victory is coming. The pain is only temporary, but the joy will go on forever. Don\u2019t discount the small things. It may seem small, but God knows how to multiply. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cGod Is Your Source\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xdNgkLoi3O You are full of gifts, talents, potential, but if you hang around friends that compromise and pull you down, if you\u2019re in an environment with limited mindsets, then you won\u2019t see the growth that you should. When you give in to weariness, you lose your strength. I\u2019m not saying to never feel weariness; it will come. I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t allow it in; that will keep you from your destiny. The resource may have dried up, but the Source is still alive and well. Click here to listen to, \"God Is Your Source\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/wUTdrezS9N God is the Source; He\u2019s the provider. The scripture says, \u201cNo good thing will He withhold because you walk uprightly.\u201d He knows where all the good things are. God wants to help you. He wants to heal you, to free you, to increase you, to take you places that you\u2019ve never dreamed. He\u2019s longing to be good to you. Look to Him as your Source. Are you recognizing the Source? Are you thanking God for every good thing? The more you acknowledge God\u2019s goodness, the more of His goodness you will see. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"God Is Your Source\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/dLk77wu2ZP When you\u2019re in difficult times, do something where God can see your faith. Make plans to get well, make plans to come out of that trouble, make plans for God to show out in your life. When you honor God, you are connected to a supply line that will never run dry. You\u2019re not at the mercy of the economy or who likes you or what your boss does. God has all kinds of resources He can use. It\u2019s easy to look to people as our source or look to our job as our source. God uses people, He uses jobs, He uses contracts, but they are not the source. God is your Source. Don\u2019t let the accuser convince you to live guilty, condemned, thinking you\u2019ve seen your best days. You may have made mistakes, but God is still planning to bring to pass what He promised you. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged. Everyone has disappointments, but if you\u2019ll stay in faith, not get bitter, God is going to bless you in such a way that you don\u2019t remember the pain of the past. Whatever you\u2019re believing for, you need to find some promises. Make a list, put it on your phone, your mirror, your computer, and then, all through the day, remind God what He promised you. Put God in remembrance of what He promised, not what you feel like, not what you deserve, not what a relative said, but what God said. Check out \"You Promised\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/odqeRPlJ57 When you\u2019re discouraged, it\u2019s easy to have an exaggerated view of your problem. Take the pressure off. You\u2019re not the only one facing what you\u2019re up against. People have been where you are. God has brought them out, and He\u2019s going to bring you out. You haven\u2019t made too many mistakes. God\u2019s calling on your life is irrevocable. He doesn\u2019t change His mind because you got off course. He\u2019s not going to leave you alone until you get back on the right path. Take a break from telling God everything that\u2019s wrong. At some point, you need to switch over to thanking Him for what He\u2019s promised. Don't miss \"You Promised\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Tg0xapu168 Shake off low expectations. Shake off what somebody told you that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t determine your destiny; God does. If you\u2019ll be a prisoner of hope, God promises He\u2019ll pay you back twice for the unfair things that have happened. This is your year for double. This is your year for vindication, for restoration, for new beginnings. You\u2019ve got to get your mind going in the right direction. Stay in faith and stay open. It may not happen your way or on your time table, but God is true to His Word. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cYou Promised\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/rxrktu60y1 Don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period. We\u2019re not going to understand everything that happens, but God is so amazing, He\u2019s going to cause you to forget the pain of the past. God planned your days for good. He crowned you with favor, He\u2019s directing your steps. The way to honor Him is to go out each day with passion, being your best, pursuing what He put in your heart. Don\u2019t compare your life to other people. Run your race. God\u2019s purpose for your life is not the same as theirs. Don\u2019t look to the left or to the right. Stay focused on your calling. God is not obligated to bring to pass what we say, but He is obligated to bring to pass what He says. When He hears His promises coming out of your mouth, angels go to work, forces of darkness are pushed back, favor is released in a new way. Sometimes we know more about the problem than we do the promise. We spend hours searching the internet, learning everything that could possibly go wrong. Why don\u2019t you spend fifteen minutes and google scriptures about what you\u2019re facing. Faith is not always going to make sense. What God says is not always going to seem logical. If you try to reason it out, check with all the experts, and study all the reports, you\u2019ll miss God\u2019s best. When you start declaring His promises, when you start speaking what He says about you, it\u2019s going to change your perspective. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"You Promised\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/s5Mxxef8jN When we face difficulties, one of the best things we can do is find a promise in the scripture and remind God what He said about us. Don\u2019t just pray the problem, pray the promises. Do the right thing when it\u2019s hard. Keep a good attitude when people are not treating you right. Go the extra mile when nobody is watching. You may not see anything happening, but you\u2019re getting prepared to go to new levels. Don\u2019t let battle fatigue keep you from your victory. Don\u2019t let weariness stop your dream from coming to pass. You are closer than you think. Don\u2019t be discouraged. God controls the opportunities. As long as you stay in faith and keep honoring Him, He\u2019ll bring the right opportunity to you. When you have a disappointment, have a bigger view. Maybe it didn\u2019t work out because God has something better coming your way. God designed your plan knowing every plot against you. The good news is, His plan will override every plan that was meant to stop you. Check out \"It's a Setup\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/sWCI5F7zEV When it\u2019s your time, no person can stop you, no bad break, no injustice. Just as God hid you, He will bring you out into the open. He\u2019ll shine His light on you and cause you to go where you could not go on your own. You always face the greatest struggle, the greatest opposition, the greatest discouragement, right before the breakthrough, right before the healing, right before you meet the person of your dreams. You have to be so convinced that God is for you that you don\u2019t fall apart when life is against you. Don't miss \"It's a Setup\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/SEMzeMWQn4 You may be facing a situation that looks impossible, and you could easily let it overwhelm you, but God has given you strength for that battle. He said you would never face something that you couldn\u2019t handle. The silence is not a sign that God is not working. He may not be changing the circumstances, but He is changing us. God uses the seasons of silence to get us prepared. Do the right thing when the wrong thing is happening. Your time is coming. What God has ordained will come to pass. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cIt's a Setup\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/cpOzykJ9RR God never runs out of favor. He has unlimited resources. Somebody else being blessed is not going to stop God from blessing you. You don\u2019t have to live worried when negative things happen, try to pay people back, be frustrated because of a disappointment. Stay in peace. God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it was going to stop you. On the other side of the difficulty is a new level of your destiny. Nothing is random. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, all things are going to work for your good.  Click here to listen to, \"It's a Setup\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/njMfuWMaxp Those people that are coming against you, those negative circumstances, they are pawns in the hand of God. The enemy thinks he\u2019s using them to hold you back; the truth is God is using them to push you forward. No person can stop Him, no crisis, no delay. All the forces of darkness cannot stop what God has purposed for your life. You can\u2019t reach your destiny without opposition, without betrayal, without criticism, without things you don\u2019t understand. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"It's a Setup\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/smIXCnYsIM The Scripture says, \u201cGod has ordered your steps.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say He suggested them: maybe this will happen, maybe that will happen. No. Your steps have been ordered. What God orders will come to pass. When you take up your cross, it doesn\u2019t mean you won't have difficulties, people won\u2019t betray you, you won\u2019t make mistakes. Life will happen. The beauty is that God will give grace, strength, favor, and joy to lift you and sustain you. The God who breathed life into you, the God who numbered your days, the God who is for you is in complete control. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"It's a Setup\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/TbrbYysQHW After all Christ has done, after the incredible price that He paid on the cross, it doesn\u2019t bring Him any honor for us to go around feeling unworthy, condemned. Let\u2019s do our part and believe that we\u2019re forgiven, redeemed, that we have an everlasting release from our sins. We wish you and your family a happy Easter as we celebrate our risen Savior! https://t.co/shrNcMivWa The scripture says, God has already accepted you, He\u2019s already blotted out your sins, He\u2019s already shed His blood. It\u2019s not if He\u2019s going to do it; He\u2019s already done it. The question is will you receive it? What you\u2019re believing for may not have happened yet, it may be taking a long time, but God is a faithful God. He\u2019s not only going to bring it to pass, but God is going to do more than you asked. When Jesus hung on that cross, He took all your mistakes, all your failures, all your weaknesses, every wrong, and He forgave it. Receive the mercy that your Heavenly Father is offering you. If you\u2019ll shake off the guilt and keep moving forward, nobody is going to be able to tell what you\u2019ve been through.

Quit listening to the accusing voices. You\u2019re forgiven; you\u2019re redeemed. Now, do your part and put on your robe of honor. Your words can limit your life or they can increase your life. They can curse your future or they can bless your future. What you\u2019re saying in the storm will determine whether you come out of that storm. Talk about how big your God is. It may seem like another routine day, everything looks the same, but God is going to show up and do something out of the ordinary, something that you didn\u2019t see coming, something that will thrust you to a new level. What\u2019s come against you is not permanent. What was meant for harm God is turning to your advantage. Be inspired by this message from Joel:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/p8ANs3PIfx When God laid out the plan for your life, He lined up everything you need to fulfill your destiny: every good break, every person, every solution, every healing. He\u2019s not trying to figure out how to do it; it\u2019s already set up. You don\u2019t have to have favor with everyone; you just need favor with the right one. A dozen people may not like you, but they can\u2019t stop you. God has the right people that will bring opportunities, favor, and promotion. What that challenge took out God is about to put back in. He\u2019s not going to just bring you out, He\u2019s going to make up for what was unfair.  Click here to listen to Joel's latest podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/2CMLlCEMZk Nothing is too much for our God. His power is greater than any force that\u2019s trying to stop you. You are not going to live addicted, depressed, sick, fearful. Those forces that have held you back are being broken. God has the final say. He says, \u201cI\u2019m going to restore the years that were stolen. I\u2019m going to pay you back for what was unfair.\u201d God will not let the actions of others keep you from your purpose. If that were the case, they would control your destiny and not God.

God is not just going to bring you through; He\u2019s going to bring you out better, refreshed, renewed, reenergized. Get this down in your spirit: you\u2019re not going to look like what you\u2019ve been through. You\u2019re going to look like who you are: blessed, prosperous, talented, successful, healthy, whole, victorious. Executive produced by @JoelOsteen, #JesusHisLife continues tomorrow!

Nothing that\u2019s coming against you is going to keep you from your destiny. Nothing you\u2019ve been through is going to hinder your future. All of it is setting you up for God to show out in your life. When you feel like you\u2019re surrounded, you have to come back to that place of peace and say, \u201cI know my God is still on the throne. He\u2019s bigger than this opposition, greater than this sickness, more powerful than these enemies.\u201d Don\u2019t fight battles with small-minded people. They are not between you and your destiny. If you get engaged in that conflict, you\u2019ll miss who you were created to be. Don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period.  When you quit putting energy into your history, and instead you put it into your destiny, then God will give you beauty for the ashes. When you\u2019re in peace, you\u2019re in a position of power.

Begging doesn\u2019t move God. Complaining doesn\u2019t sway Him, but praise causes the Creator of the Universe to show up. What God has stored up for you will be perfect for your life. Celebrate the successes of others knowing that God blessing them is not going to stop what God has for you. Don\u2019t let other people ruin your day.

If you don\u2019t get rid of the wrong people, you\u2019ll never meet the right people. If somebody left you, you have to realize their part in your story is over. If they walked away, then you don\u2019t need them. If God allowed it, then that means they\u2019re not a part of your destiny. Most of the things that come against us are simply distractions. If that battle is not between you and your destiny, you should ignore it. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cProtect Your Peace\u201d.

He\u2019s already lined up the right people, the right breaks, favor and increase. Psalm 31:19 says, \u201cYou have stored up great blessings for those who honor You.\u201d As good as the people are in your life, there are no perfect people. There is no perfect boss, no perfect friend, no perfect neighbor, no perfect spouse. Give people room to be human. Quit expecting them to perform perfectly all the time. Are you distracted fighting battles that don\u2019t matter and they're keeping you from the ones that do matter? You have to learn to walk away from things.

You are responsible for your own happiness. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to get good at ignoring things. Ignore negative comments, ignore insults, ignore the naysayers. They are distractions trying to keep you from God\u2019s best. At the start of the day, you need to decide that no matter what comes your way, you\u2019re not going to get upset. You need to make up your mind to stay in peace. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Protect Your Peace\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/QElX0XGXLg It\u2019s not about winning the fight. Walking away from battles that don\u2019t matter is not weak; that takes a strong person. That\u2019s a mark of honor. There may be people you see every day that have the gift of getting on your nerves. The good news is you\u2019re in control. They can\u2019t make you unhappy unless you allow them to. The way to honor God is to go out each day with passion, being your best, pursuing what He put in your heart. Don\u2019t get stuck in the potholes of life. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Protect Your Peace\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/ywXS8wEOab God is your vindicator. He will make up for the wrongs that were done to you. If you will stay in peace, stay on the high road, God will vindicate you better than you can vindicate yourself. We look at things logically, but God is a supernatural God. He specializes in exceeding our expectations. What He has planned for you is bigger, more rewarding, more fulfilling than you\u2019ve dreamed. Life is too short to waste another day being upset. It\u2019s not always easy to get over it, but the pain of letting it go is less than the pain of holding on and missing your destiny. We all go through unfair situations and things we don\u2019t understand. If that were going to keep you from your destiny, God would never have allowed it. Don\u2019t use it as an excuse to settle. Stir up what God put on the inside and you\u2019ll go places that you've never dreamed. People don\u2019t have the final say; people don\u2019t control your destiny.

Everything that\u2019s holding you back is being broken right now. The enemy meant it for your harm. He\u2019d love to convince you to live discouraged, not pursing your dreams, thinking it\u2019s never going to work out. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It\u2019s setting you up for new levels of your destiny. 32 years ago I married the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever known, both on the inside and the outside.

Don't miss \"Declare Favor\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/oizcDCSvSM What God has ordained, no person can stop, no bad break, no addiction. If you\u2019ll keep honoring God, being your best, what God has set up will find you. You won\u2019t have to go after it; it will come after you. Just because you gave up doesn\u2019t mean God gave up. You may not see a way, but God has a way. Put your faith out there. All through the day, \u201cFather, thank You that You\u2019re going to exceed my expectations.\u201d What about the dreams God has put in your heart? You need to speak favor over them. Do you have problems that look too big? Declare the favor of God is turning them around. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cDeclare Favor\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ff6VBb0bRt The scripture says, \u201cNo person has seen, heard, or imagined what God has prepared for those that love Him.\u201d God has some things prepared that are going to amaze you. It\u2019s one thing to think it, but when you declare it, angels go to work. In the unseen realm, things begin to happen. We\u2019ve hoped, we\u2019ve prayed, we\u2019ve believed, that\u2019s good, but it\u2019s time to start speaking favor.

RT @VictoriaOsteen: I\u2019m excited about my new book \u201cExceptional You!\u201d available today! I believe that God has called &amp; equipped you to live\u2026 When you not only recognize you have favor, but you declare favor, God will show out in your life. You\u2019ll see things you didn\u2019t deserve. You are God\u2019s biggest deal. You\u2019re His most prized possession. He wants to show you His goodness. That\u2019s what favor is. The favor of God is bringing healing, freedom, vindication, victory into your life. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Declare Favor\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ygOcv1wSlW When you declare favor, God will move people out of the way to make room for you. Favor will bring opportunities. Favor will promote you suddenly, unexpectedly; things will happen that you didn\u2019t see coming. We serve a supernatural God. One touch of His favor will catapult you ahead. They may be negative, discouraging, condescending, but let that go in one ear and out the other. None of that can stop your purpose. There is a connection between speaking favor and receiving favor. It\u2019s not enough to just believe you have favor; it\u2019s not enough to just expect favor. You have to take it one step further and declare favor. Those things you\u2019re believing for? You\u2019ve never been closer than right now. It\u2019s at hand. Quit telling yourself that it\u2019s way off in the distance. God is saying, \u201cYou\u2019re closer than you think.\u201d What God has in your future can\u2019t be accomplished on your own. The places He\u2019s going to take you, you can\u2019t get there by yourself. That wasn\u2019t a coincidence; that\u2019s the favor of God. We pray, \u201cGod, keep me out of the furnace. Keep me out of that problem.\u201d Sometimes God will deliver us from the fire, but most of the time, God will make you fireproof and take you through the fire. One touch of God\u2019s favor will do more than we can do on our own in our whole lifetime. Check out \"The Power of Favor\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/aybkAplek7 Get your fire back; put a smile on your face. Start moving forward. You thought it was over and done, but God has a new beginning, a new relationship, a new dream, something more rewarding than you\u2019ve ever imagined. What\u2019s happened to you is over and done. You can\u2019t go into a new season if you\u2019re always looking back at the old. The greater the opposition, the greater the endorsement. The more the enemy tries to pull you back, the more you\u2019re going to move forward. Don't miss \"The Power of Favor\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/w2QnVpd5rw You may feel like you\u2019re doing the same thing over and over, but when it feels like you\u2019re going in circles, something is happening that you can\u2019t see. You\u2019re coming up higher; you\u2019re growing. God is making you and molding you. Don\u2019t be discouraged by what\u2019s not lining up. It\u2019s not over. God is still working. Behind the scenes, things are happening that you can\u2019t see. Keep thanking Him that it\u2019s on the way. When God endorses you, it\u2019s not like people showing you favor. That\u2019s nice, but when God does it, it catapults you ahead. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cThe Power of Favor\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kh09FZNqAM What are you allowing in your spirit? Is it inspiring you, building your faith, pushing you toward your dreams? Or is it junk food, feeding your guilt, insecurity, fear, and compromise? God has something bigger. He\u2019s going to use you to accomplish something significant, not just be a small part. You\u2019re going to stand out; you\u2019re going to shine. People are going to see the greatness in you. Chicago, we hope you'll make plans for our next Night of Hope, April 5 at the @AllstateArena! Click here for details: https://t.co/vIv71H7WDK https://t.co/E7W3PzaWzI Having favor doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have challenges.

Click here to listen to, \"The Power of Favor\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/WQHQ2lC46D You\u2019ve been in the background long enough. You\u2019ve served faithfully, helped others without any recognition, done the right thing when people didn\u2019t give you credit. Your time is coming. The truth is you don\u2019t have to have people believe in you. The Most High God believes in you. His endorsement can thrust you to a new level of your destiny and make up for all the lonely years. One touch of favor is worth more than a lifetime of labor. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"The Power of Favor\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/tPKguZTOTn God knows how to endorse you. He knows how to make your life significant. This is not so that we can say how great we are and show off what we\u2019ve become; it\u2019s about letting God\u2019s glory be seen through you. God is not going to just deliver you; He\u2019s not just going to bring you out. He\u2019s going to endorse you. He\u2019s going to put you in a position of greater prominence, where people see you honored, respected, and admired. God is about to do something unusual, something that you\u2019ve never seen: promotion that you didn\u2019t work for, good breaks that you didn\u2019t deserve. You can\u2019t explain it; you can\u2019t take credit for it. It\u2019s the favor of God. You\u2019re not going to understand why everything happens. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, it won\u2019t work against you; it will work for you. Nothing that\u2019s happened to you is a surprise to God. You\u2019ve got to take the hand you\u2019ve been dealt and make the most of it. Part of faith is stepping into the unknown. The good news is God is in the scary places. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see Him show out. In the scary place, He\u2019ll take you somewhere you\u2019ve never dreamed. Don\u2019t let battle fatigue keep you from your victory. Don\u2019t let weariness stop your dream from coming to pass. You are closer than you think. #JesusHisLife premieres Monday, March 25 on @HISTORY at 8/7c.

This is your time to shine. Get rid of those limiting excuses. Stay open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. When you answer critics, you go down to their level. Instead, stay on the mountain and focus on what you know is important. Don\u2019t miss your destiny. Don\u2019t get comfortable and never take any risk. You have to pursue what God put in your heart. Don't miss \"Scared Into Greatness\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xfhFbBGZH1 You have exactly what you need. If you need what they have, God would give it to you. Quit comparing yourself and start running your own race. You are anointed to be you. As long as you\u2019re making excuses, you\u2019ll justify staying where you are. Excuses give us permission to settle for less than God\u2019s best. It may have been passed down to you, but the good news is you have the power to overcome it. God is about to take you to a new level. You\u2019re about to soar to new heights, to new levels of influence and favor.  Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cScared Into Greatness\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/CrQGSaKfPL God knows what you\u2019re going to need, when you\u2019re going to need it, and how to get it to you. That problem you\u2019re worried about? God has the answer already in route. The vindication, the healing, the breakthrough is already set up. If you weren\u2019t afraid, it wouldn\u2019t be your destiny. What God has for you is bigger. It\u2019s something that you haven\u2019t seen: new levels of influence, favor, opportunity.

We may not understand it, but I have never come out of a scary place without getting better. The scary places give me a greater trust in God. If you can do everything in your own strength, then you don\u2019t need faith.  At some point, you have to put a demand on your faith. You have to stretch, dream a bigger dream.

The scary place is where we grow. It\u2019s where we discover our wings so we can soar and become who we were created to be. We don\u2019t grow when everything is going our way. We grow when we have to stretch, when we\u2019re uncomfortable, when we\u2019re a little bit nervous. Sometimes God will shake things up. He\u2019ll use the scary places to move us into our destiny. It\u2019s uncomfortable. You don\u2019t like it, but God uses the scary places to move us into our destiny. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Scared Into Greatness\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/mK9jjK13vG This is your time. This is your moment. Your destiny is calling. Step into the scary place. That\u2019s where God is. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see His favor. If you\u2019ll keep the right attitude, you\u2019ll not only come out, but God will use that difficulty to establish you, to give you more credibility, to take you to a new level. People may rule you out, they may tell you it\u2019s not going to happen, but God has the final say. He knows how to take you from the background to the foreground. When He decides to bless you, He\u2019s going to make something happen that you didn\u2019t see coming. It may not have been fair, but God is fair. He knows how to make it up to you, but you have to let go of what didn\u2019t work out. Quit putting energy into negative things of the past. Keep your faith out there. Thoughts will tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d No, get ready. You\u2019re about to come into unexpected favor. Check out \"The God Who Crosses His Arms\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/QKjYpfqjkb The scripture says, \u201cThe spirit of faith is in our words.\u201d What kind of words are coming out of your mouth? Are you talking about how big the problem is or are you talking about how big our God is? God knows how to take mistakes we\u2019ve made and turn them into miracles. It\u2019s not too late. You haven\u2019t missed your chance. You don\u2019t know what God is up to. He can make things happen that you never dreamed would happen. When God puts a promise in your heart, people can\u2019t stop you. Bad breaks can\u2019t stop you. Betrayal, rejection can't stop you. People don\u2019t determine your destiny. God does.

Now, God is about to show you His power. This is a year where you\u2019re going to take new ground, new ground in your finances, new ground in your health, new ground in your relationships. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"The Joshua Generation\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/x3SFAvdXLh You are a part of the Joshua generation. You\u2019re not going to just dream the dream; you\u2019re going to live your dream. You\u2019re going to go where no one in your family has gone. You may have some big obstacles in front of you. It looks like you\u2019re stuck. Don\u2019t worry; they are no match for our God. Keep praising. Keep believing. Keep expecting. The Lord is going to take you where you could not go on your own. You\u2019re the Joshua generation. There\u2019s a blessing on your life that\u2019s going to thrust you to a new level. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"The Joshua Generation\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/r2Y7fzvBE3 You are not going to be at the same place next year as you are right now. You\u2019re about to take new ground. What has held you back has been broken. God is about to enlarge your territory. New opportunities are coming. When you sow a seed of kindness, a seed of forgiveness, a seed of helping someone that hurt you, you\u2019re proving to God that He can trust you. Your character is coming up higher. That\u2019s when God will release more favor in your life. On the way to your miracle, on the way to your promotion, to your healing, there will be plenty of opportunities to let pride stop you. Stay open. Don\u2019t get set in your ways. God likes to do unusual things. You don\u2019t have to beg people to stay. You are a gift. You are a prize. You are exceptional. Let the wrong people go, and God will send people that value who you are, people that can\u2019t wait to be with you. If you\u2019ll take the hand you\u2019ve been dealt and make the most of it, God\u2019s favor will take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own. Check out Joel's new podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/E21aNH4noI Complainers are a dime a dozen. Compromisers are all around. But God is looking for uncommon people, people that don\u2019t take the easy way out, people that don\u2019t lower their standards. He\u2019s looking for people that have uncommon faith, that believe for things that seem impossible. We\u2019re all so busy these days. We all have our own challenges. If we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll pass by people in need. Just let them know that you care. There\u2019s no greater feeling and nothing is more rewarding than helping others rise higher. When God makes up for what you lost, it\u2019s not going to be less than; it\u2019s going to be better. You don\u2019t have to settle for second best.  Don't miss \"Kiss It Goodbye\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/jSNIxbTKp4 If you want to see real joy, real fulfillment, if you want to have peace, then be kind to people when there\u2019s no reason. Show mercy. Be the smile of God. One compliment can have an impact for a lifetime. Don\u2019t withhold your blessing. Your words can impact people years from now. God is still in control. Quit reliving mistakes you\u2019ve made. Trust God with your successes and your failures.  Be inspired by this new message from Joel. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/1tejPgPtfz God\u2019s ways are not our ways. But if you\u2019ll stay in faith, that storm won\u2019t set you back; it will propel you forward. When it\u2019s all said and done, you\u2019ll be at a new level of your destiny. What you\u2019re not willing to walk away from is where you\u2019ll get stuck. If you don\u2019t let go of the wrong people, you\u2019ll never meet the right people. If someone is not adding value to your life, making you better, pushing you into your destiny, you need to make a change. If it didn\u2019t work out the way you had planned, it wasn\u2019t supposed to.  Will you trust Him when it doesn\u2019t make sense?  Click here to listen to, \"Kiss It Goodbye\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/neJBTxwVTv You can\u2019t think the same way and expect different results. Start embracing who God says you are. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. You are a masterpiece. To reach new levels, you have to have some favor connections. You need to be sowing time, energy, resources, and honor into people that have what you need. The anointing you respect is the anointing you attract. Don\u2019t bring bitterness into the New Year. You cannot embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding on to the old. Get Joel's new message now on podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/WRxATrwcam You don\u2019t have time to get distracted by all the negative chatter. There\u2019s always going to be someone that doesn\u2019t like you. Tune it out and keep moving forward. You\u2019ve spent enough energy on the past; that\u2019s not taking you anywhere. Kiss the disappointment goodbye.  You can\u2019t embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding on to the old. People may walk away, life may not turn out the way you had thought, but God has something better in front of you.

It takes a lot of energy to relive hurts, wonder why it didn\u2019t work out. If it didn\u2019t work out the way you had planned, it wasn\u2019t supposed to. God promised He would arm you with strength for every battle. We may not know what the future holds, but we know Who holds the future. Don\u2019t miss today worried about tomorrow. Today is a gift. You can never get this day back. Declare your healing. Declare your freedom. Declare your dreams are coming to pass. Jesus said, \u201cIf you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain move and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d Too often, we\u2019re looking at what people can\u2019t do when we should be looking at what God can do. People can\u2019t undo every wrong. They can\u2019t give you back the years that they hurt you and put you at a disadvantage. The good news is God can. You will become what you\u2019re saying.  Are you speaking faith-filled words over yourself, over your children, your health, your finances?  Check out Joel's latest Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/clqb2vVmpd Don\u2019t live stressed out over other people\u2019s poor choices. You have a destiny to fulfill. You need your energy, your strength, your creativity to be who you were created to be. Life is not about being angry, getting revenge, and being mean to people that have been mean to you. That\u2019s a shallow way to live. Instead, lift someone up when they've pushed you down. Keep the right perspective. You may feel like the underdog, but you and God are a majority. You don\u2019t need everyone to be for you. You don\u2019t have to have all the support and encouragement. You have the One Who matters. Just because you\u2019ve given up doesn\u2019t mean God has given up. He didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you where you are. It may feel like it\u2019s over out, but God is saying, \u201cLook again. That dream you\u2019ve given up on, I\u2019m still going to bring it to pass.\u201d The people around you may not see the greatness in you. Don\u2019t let them talk you out of what God put in your heart. Speak victory in spite of what the naysayers think. Listen to Joel's latest message: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/28fcoQd3MD God didn\u2019t say we wouldn\u2019t have storms, but He did say He would give us peace in the midst of the storm. Life happens. Despite what\u2019s going on around you, you can still be at peace. With God, all things are possible. What He started, He\u2019s going to finish. You\u2019re not too old. It\u2019s not too late. You haven\u2019t missed too many opportunities. You\u2019re right on schedule. Your dream is coming. Your healing is coming. Your breakthrough is coming. You need to announce to that giant in your path, \u201cI will defeat you. You are not going to keep me from my destiny.\"  Click here to listen: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kBciZ4aKPE Declare your vision in spite of what the experts are telling you. People don\u2019t determine your destiny. They don\u2019t know what God put in you. Don\u2019t let their negative words keep you from speaking your faith-filled words. God has spoken promises to your spirit that may seem too big, impossible. You don\u2019t have the connections, the experience, the funds. Get in agreement with God. Dare to declare what He put in your heart. If you\u2019ll start speaking victory, declaring that you are well able, that you are blessed, you\u2019ll accomplish dreams that others thought were impossible. Get this encouraging message from Joel: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/QUpTKuC4hB Keep doing the right thing. Keep going to work with a good attitude. You\u2019re not working unto people; you\u2019re working unto God. Your job is not your source, God is your source. He\u2019s keeping the records. Your time is coming. You have to release the miracle. When you say, \u201cI am free,\u201d in the unseen realm, chains are broken, strongholds are loosed. You are prophesying your future. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth. Our words have creative power. When we speak something out, we\u2019re giving it the right to come to pass. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Miracles In Your Mouth\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/9CkdczTgTX Are you at peace with your scars? Are you looking back with gratitude or are you looking back bitter, wondering why it happened? Have a new perspective. The scar means you\u2019re healed. The scar means you\u2019re forgiven. The scar means you can walk again. It\u2019s easy to get bitter and give up on your dreams. But God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it was going to keep you from your destiny. What you\u2019re going through may not be good, but God knows how to bring good out of it. Learn to pray when everything is going wrong. Trouble teaches you how to stand strong. It\u2019s taking you to the next level of your destiny; it\u2019s getting you prepared. You are fully loaded. You\u2019re not lacking. You\u2019re not at a deficit. You are full of potential, full of favor, full of ideas. Check out \"You Are Fully Loaded\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nvTFLlijJW You may have had some bad breaks, but God is not finished with you. The enemy doesn\u2019t have the last word. God does. Are you living bitter, angry, negative? Go back to who God created you to be. He calls you blessed, forgiven, victorious. People didn\u2019t lay out your plan and purpose. When you come to the end of life, you\u2019re not going to answer to people. You\u2019re going to answer to God. The person that makes the first move is the bigger person. God will reward you in a greater way if you take the first step. Pride will tell you don\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t deserve it. You have to put your ego down. If you\u2019re going to reach your highest potential, you have to humble yourself and do things you don\u2019t understand. It takes humility to be the bigger person. Run your race. If someone passes you by, don\u2019t be intimidated; be inspired. If God did it for them, He can do it for you. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cYou Are Fully Loaded\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/UJTUlCrtnj Start hoping again, dreaming again, believing again. God\u2019s going to bring opportunities you've never dreamed about. What\u2019s in your future is much greater than what you lost. Now, don\u2019t let anything keep you from your destiny. The enemy would love to keep your dream buried and convince you that it\u2019s never going to happen; it\u2019s too late. Don\u2019t believe those lies. You can still accomplish your dreams. You can still become all you were created to be. The key is to be you. When you\u2019re you, you activate your anointing. There\u2019s a favor, a blessing, a grace that is unique to your life. Click here to listen to, \"You Are Fully Loaded\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/6dStCikDBp There\u2019s no grace on your life to be somebody else. Be free to be you. Quit trying to imitate someone else and step into your anointing. When you understand that you are fully equipped for the race designed for you, instead of competing with people, you\u2019ll celebrate them. The right attitude is, \u201cThey may have something I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not running their race. I\u2019m equipped for my destiny.\u201d The anointing on your life is to be who God called you to be. Be confident in what you have. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"You Are Fully Loaded\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/DkMY7oideD There will always be pressure to be this, to be that, to be the other. Everyone has their opinion. But down in your heart, you know who you are. Don\u2019t let people or pressure try to squeeze you into something that you\u2019re not. Your race has been designed specifically for you. You\u2019re not in competition with your friends, your neighbors, your siblings, your coworkers. The only competition you have is with yourself\u2014to be the best that you can be. When God created you, He said, \u201cThat was very good.\u201d  The only time He used \u201cvery good\u201d was when He created you. He calls you a masterpiece. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"You Are Fully Loaded\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/l9F8RoVHk7 There will never be another you. Let your gifts shine. Show your personality, your talent, your style. We don\u2019t need an imitation. We don\u2019t need a copy. We need the original you. People may rule you out, they may tell you it\u2019s not going to happen, but God has the final say. He knows how to take you from the background to the foreground. When He decides to bless you, He\u2019s going to make something happen that you didn\u2019t see coming. You haven\u2019t made too many wrong turns. You haven\u2019t missed too many exits. Your heavenly Father is not mad at you. He\u2019s saying, \u201cI have a way to get you to your destiny. The mistake didn\u2019t stop My plan. The delay didn\u2019t cancel your purpose.\u201d Being right is overrated. You can be right and be miserable. You can be right and sleep on the couch. You can win every battle, prove your point, but what you don\u2019t realize is you're damaging your relationships. RT @JoelOsteenRadio: Join us for the @JoelOsteen &amp; @VictoriaOsteen Super Bowl Radio Special with guests @drewbrees ~ @JBsportscaster ~ @Ton\u2026 Don\u2019t discount the power of serving.

Check out \"Serve Your Way Up\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/4wORPcyAD3 There will always be forces trying to convince you to settle where you are, but you have to stir your faith up. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. What He started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s happiness. You are responsible for your own happiness. Some people don\u2019t want to be happy; they like the attention it brings. As long as you feel guilty and keep giving in, the one person that\u2019s going to be unhappy is you. Sometimes we don\u2019t serve because it seems small, insignificant. But on the way to the big things God has in store, He will test us with small things. Don't miss \"Serve Your Way Up\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/pCC8C2kJ9A If a battle is not between you and your God-given destiny, it is simply a distraction. Don\u2019t fight battles that don\u2019t matter. The scripture says, \u201cIs the arm of the Lord too short to deliver?\u201d Do you think His arm is too short that He can\u2019t reach you: your problem is too big, you\u2019ve made too many mistakes? No, the arm of the Lord is not too short to provide for you, to vindicate you, to promote you. Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people; it comes from God. When it\u2019s your time, He\u2019ll cause people to notice you. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cServe Your Way Up\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/dwhLeTSeAi The true mark of a champion is even though some dirt gets thrown on a dream, instead of letting it get buried you keep shaking it off. Looking for new ways to move forward, believing for new opportunities. You can do the right thing with the wrong attitude and miss your blessing. God is not looking just at what you do; He\u2019s looking at your heart. What you do in secret, God will reward in the open. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not getting credit.

You\u2019re never wasting time serving others. It\u2019s a part of God\u2019s plan. You can not reach your destiny without being faithful to another person\u2019s dream.

God brings people and opportunities across our path so we can be a blessing. When you serve others, you\u2019re serving God. Keep being your best where you are, going the extra mile, and the blessing will come to you. The right people, the promotion, the good breaks will find you.

Don\u2019t get discouraged if people don\u2019t thank you. God sees your sacrifice. When you give, He gives you more back. When you show someone favor, He shows you more favor. We don\u2019t realize the power of our words, the power of a simple compliment, the power of, \u201cI believe in you. You\u2019re going to make it.\u201d Your words may seem ordinary to you, but when God breathes life into them, they become extraordinary to the other person. It\u2019s good to remember the great things God has done, but God doesn\u2019t want you to live off of yesterday\u2019s victories. God is about to give you something new to talk about. He\u2019s about to give you some fresh victories. When you turn it over to God and trust Him to be your vindicator, trust Him to work out His plan for your life, then you\u2019ll not only feel that weight lift off of you, but you\u2019ll begin to dream again. You\u2019ll see the new things He has in store. What you can\u2019t see is that cutback is setting you up for new levels. You\u2019re about to come into a season of much fruit: increase, promotion, better than you\u2019ve imagined. Check out \"Pruned for Promotion\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EsyvGz26p8 Look around at who\u2019s in your life. They\u2019re not there by accident. They need what you have: encouragement and affirmation. Don\u2019t keep the healing to yourself. Be free with your compliments. A blessing is not a blessing until it\u2019s spoken. Our attitude should be, \u201cMy life is an open book. I have nothing to hide. God, You know everything I am and everything I\u2019m not. Make me, mold me, change me where I need to be changed. Help me to become who You\u2019ve created me to be.\u201d When you stay in peace, that\u2019s a place of power. If you don\u2019t have peace on the inside, you won\u2019t have peace on the outside. Keep your heart pure. Life is too short to live offended, not forgiving, bitter over what didn\u2019t work out. Quit letting what\u2019s on the outside get on the inside. Start guarding your heart. Some things you have to endure. The way to do it is to know that it\u2019s not permanent and that you\u2019re going to come out better. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cPruned for Promotion\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/knOavr2GlC When you\u2019re bitter, it affects every area of your life. You have to let it go. Bitterness will keep you from your destiny. It\u2019s going to pull you down into depression, steal your dreams, and rob you of your joy. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing is a coincidence. There are times God will allow us to go through a difficulty so later on, we can be instrumental in helping others overcome. We may not like the cutbacks, but God is the gardener. He\u2019s not going to cut something back without giving you more in return. Dare to trust Him. Click here to listen to, \"Pruned for Promotion\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/fjhItZ9k8a Are you discouraged over something you lost, something that hasn\u2019t worked out, thinking the enemy has hindered you when, in fact, it\u2019s the hand of God? We give the enemy too much credit. He can\u2019t touch you without God\u2019s permission. Trouble prepares you for the next level. Trouble develops something in you that you can\u2019t get when it\u2019s easy and everything is going your way. In the difficult times, your spiritual muscles develop and you gain strength, endurance, and wisdom. Be faithful in the cutback season. The cutback season is a sign that new growth is coming. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Pruned for Promotion\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Wl0KIukyiK Sometimes the favor of God comes disguised as a cutback. It takes maturity to distinguish between the enemy trying to stop you and the gardener at work. Too often we\u2019re discouraged over what God has ordained. It may not make sense to you; it may be uncomfortable. You may feel like you\u2019re going the wrong direction, but you don\u2019t know what God is up to. You may have been cut back, but God is saying, \u201cWatch where you\u2019ll be next year.\u201d He loves you too much to let you miss your destiny.  Will you trust Him in the cutback season; will you keep doing the right thing in the times of pruning?  Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Pruned for Promotion\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/4xZxWYgGA3 Just as there are seasons of growth, there are seasons of pruning. Without pruning, we won\u2019t become all we're created to be. God wouldn\u2019t let you go through a cutback if it wasn't going to work for your good. Paying people back is overrated. Being vindictive, getting even doesn\u2019t bring you lasting joy. But when you dig deep and show mercy to those that have hurt you, you\u2019ll feel a joy deep down in your spirit. It\u2019s the smile of God. Words have creative power. If you\u2019ll receive them into your spirit, they can help ignite your faith, ignite the dreams, ignite the potential that God\u2019s put on the inside. The process may be uncomfortable, but the purpose is worth it. If you could see where God is going to take you, the favor, the influence, the abundance, the health, the friends, you wouldn\u2019t complain about what you\u2019re going through. Stay full of hope. Keep thanking God that abundant rain is on the way. Keep expecting things to change. That\u2019s how you stay out of the dry place. Check out \"The Danger of Dry Places\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/8NFUYwWROI Don\u2019t waste your valuable time with people that can\u2019t celebrate the blessing God put on your life. Don\u2019t apologize for it. Don\u2019t try to downplay it. You didn\u2019t choose it; God chose you. God does not disqualify you because of how you were raised. You may come from a family that didn\u2019t honor God: there were a lot of compromises, dysfunctions. God is going to adopt you in spite of what they did or didn\u2019t do. If you want to see real joy, real fulfillment, if you want to lie down at night in peace, then be kind to people when there\u2019s no reason. Show mercy when you have the advantage. Lift someone up when they pushed you down. Be the smile of God. Many things God asks us to do are not fair. It\u2019s not about being fair; it\u2019s about passing the test. If you\u2019ll do the right thing when it\u2019s hard, God will make it up to you. The people that stay happy are the people that rule their thoughts, the people that stay full of hope, the people that know that God is still on the throne.

Don\u2019t find five depressed friends and sit around and talk about how bad life is. Find some friends that are happy, energetic, positive. You need to be around people that are fun, people that laugh, people that brighten your day. Don\u2019t wait for thoughts of hope and faith to come; think them on purpose. If you\u2019ll fill your mind with the right thoughts, there won\u2019t be any room for the wrong thoughts. Arise from the depression. Shake off what didn\u2019t work out. Come out of that dry place. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"The Danger of Dry Places\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/GnJzCXeOB8 You have to take control of your thought life. That\u2019s where the battle is taking place. Thoughts will tell you, \u201cYou\u2019re a victim. Life hasn\u2019t been fair. The company doesn\u2019t appreciate you.\u201d If you let those thoughts continue to play, they\u2019ll keep you from your destiny. Forgive the people that did you wrong. They hurt you once, don\u2019t let them continue to hurt you. They can\u2019t stop your destiny unless you allow them to. You\u2019re not forgiving for their sake; you\u2019re forgiving for your sake. God is not only strategically directing your steps, but He\u2019s orchestrating everything around you. He\u2019s lined up the people that will not only be there to meet you, but they\u2019ll lead you to your blessing, lead you to your promotion. When you walk in integrity, God has a shield around you. There is a blessing on your life that protects you and guards you when you honor Him. Check out \"The Rewards of Integrity\" on Podcast here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/tRQ0xa70oy Proverbs 4:23 says, \u201cGuard your heart with all diligence, for out of it, flow the issues of life.\u201d One of our main responsibilities is to keep our heart pure. Life is too short to live offended, not forgiving, bitter over what didn\u2019t work out. What God has ordained, no person can stop, no bad break, no addiction. If you\u2019ll keep honoring God, being your best, what God has set up will find you. You won\u2019t have to go after it; it will come after you. The key is to forgive quickly. The longer you hold onto bitterness, the harder it is to get rid of. Let go of things you don\u2019t understand right away. God sees what\u2019s happening. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair. He knows who walked away. And He knows how to make it up to you. He knows how to bring you out better. Let it go and trust God to be your vindicator. Be a person of integrity, trustworthy, and honorable. That\u2019s the kind of person God rewards. Stay inspired with this message from Joel, \u201cThe Rewards of Integrity\". Get it here:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/CYMXxvv88j Sometimes God will put a promise in your heart that\u2019s hard to believe. Let the seed take root. The promise God put in you may seem far out, but God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. People judge by the outside. They\u2019ll try to write you off, but they don\u2019t know what God put in you. They can\u2019t see your seeds of greatness. They don\u2019t know what God has already set up for you. How you live in private will determine how high you go in public. People may not be watching, but God is watching. Pass the tests, then God will take you to new levels. Click here to listen to, \"The Rewards of Integrity\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/wbqpqbQfrT You can have talent, determination, and vision, but without integrity, you won\u2019t reach your full potential. When you honor God, when you stay on the high road and do the right thing, that will take you much further than being dishonest and manipulative, trying to gain an unfair advantage. There\u2019s a lot we can get away with. But, anything we gain without integrity won\u2019t be as good as it could have been. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"The Rewards of Integrity\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/9IICyZGScX You may have made mistakes in the past, that\u2019s okay. We all have. My challenge is start making things right. Let today be a new beginning. Don\u2019t go the next thirty years letting the same things hold you back. When we compromise, when we do something that\u2019s questionable, we think we\u2019re gaining an advantage with people, getting the upper hand.  But, when you walk in integrity, you\u2019re gaining an advantage with God. Your reputation is too important to let it become tarnished by not having integrity. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"The Rewards of Integrity\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/s0lSTTpwCr Integrity is the foundation of a successful life. You can have talent, determination, vision, but without integrity, you won\u2019t reach your full potential. A person of integrity does the right thing when no one is watching. When people are talking about you, don\u2019t worry; God hears it. He\u2019s your defender, and He will prepare a table before you in the presence of your enemies. The very ones that are trying to hold you down, they will see you in a position of honor. That\u2019s your defender going to work. God doesn\u2019t always bless the way we expect. He can take those in the back, those that don\u2019t have the position, those that feel left out, and put them in the front. God loves to choose people that others think are not qualified. You may have a thousand excuses why you can\u2019t accomplish your dreams, why you can\u2019t get out of that problem. God is saying to you, \u201cI\u2019m about to show you unexpected favor, unexpected increase, unexpected promotion.\u201d People don\u2019t determine your destiny.  What they say about you cannot stop what God has ordained for your life.

You\u2019re not at the mercy of your age, your education, your background, where you work, what family you come from. God has unlimited power. One touch of His favor will catapult you years ahead. It\u2019s easy to live with regrets, thinking about what you should have done. Don\u2019t go through life looking in your rear view mirror. You can\u2019t do anything about the past, but you can do something about your future. @DominickMwalim You are very important to us. Our team will be praying for you.

He\u2019s going to make things happen that you could never make happen on your own. You have to get away from people that only see you for who you used to be and not for who you\u2019re about to be. People don\u2019t determine your destiny. What they say, how they make you feel, cannot stop what God has ordained for your life. Nothing that\u2019s happened to you has to keep you from your destiny.  If it were going to stop your purpose, God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it.

Quit dwelling on it; quit reliving it. You\u2019re not going to understand everything that happens, but God has a purpose. He knows how to bring good out of it. Keep moving forward. Maybe lack and struggle have followed you around for years. You could easily settle for mediocrity, think you\u2019ve reached your limits. No, get ready. One touch of God\u2019s favor can thrust you to the next level. Your words can limit your life or they can increase your life. They can curse your future or they can bless your future. Don\u2019t talk about how big your problem is, talk about how big your God is. If you\u2019re going to reach your highest potential, you have to be bold enough to ask big, to pray big, to expect big. Not arrogantly, but in humility, dare to believe. The promise is not that you won\u2019t have difficulties. The promise is God will bring you out, not of some of them, but out of all of them.

You may have a situation right now that looks like it will never work out, but what\u2019s not being taken into account is the favor on your life. You need to get ready. God is about to show out in your life. He\u2019s about to turn some things around. You don\u2019t have to prove to people who you are; you don\u2019t have to convince them that you\u2019re right. God is your vindicator. He knows how to get their attention; He knows how to change their mind. That problem you think will never turn around, He\u2019s already set up the answer. It\u2019s not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you had the problem. They may not have believed before, but when people see God show out in your life, and you go where you never dreamed, they won\u2019t be able to deny the blessing on your life.

The process may be painful, but the purpose is going to be well worth it. One day, you\u2019re going to look back and see how God used everything you went through. Sometimes God will take you through a season of being alone. This is a time where you draw closer to God. Don\u2019t fight a season of aloneness. If you\u2019ll embrace it, you\u2019ll develop something that otherwise you would never have. It\u2019s easy to let the pressures of life weigh us down. We have bills to pay, traffic to deal with, people that are rude. If we\u2019re not careful, we'll realize that we don\u2019t smile as much, laugh as much. God didn\u2019t create you to live with heaviness. Choose to live full of joy. The enemy will remind you of everything you\u2019ve done wrong, all the mistakes you\u2019ve made.

God sees what\u2019s unfair. He\u2019s not just going to bring you out; He\u2019s going to bring you out with abundance. He's going to exceed your expectations. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cIt's Payback Time\". Get it here:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/PbrJqdqXBn If you look back over your life, the times you really grew, came up higher, developed a greater confidence, weren\u2019t the good times when everything was going great; it was when you hit a bump in the road. You couldn\u2019t see it then, but God used it to refine you, to make you better. The disappointments, the people that did you wrong, are not the end. The enemy would love to convince you to live discouraged, not pursing your dreams, thinking it\u2019s never going to work out. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It\u2019s setting you up for new levels of your destiny. This is a new day. Healing is coming, vindication is coming, promotion is coming, new relationships are coming. Click here to listen to, \"It's Payback Time\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/jXlmGze0x3 God is in control. One touch of His favor will catapult you to the next level. He knows how to move the wrong people out. They may be stopping you now, but they\u2019re not going to stop you your whole life. Keep doing the right thing when the wrong thing is happening. You\u2019re not working unto people; you\u2019re working unto God. Nobody can pay you back like God can pay you back. God sees how you were treated. The enemy may have meant it to stop you, but God will use it to increase you.  Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"It's Payback Time\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/antKK2hL5h He's a God of justice. He\u2019s seen what you\u2019ve been through; He\u2019s seen what wasn\u2019t fair. He\u2019s saying to you today, \"Payback is coming.\" Not partial, not halfway, not three fourths, you\u2019re going to get it all back. Don\u2019t live bitter, thinking you have to get even. It\u2019s not your battle; the battle is the Lord\u2019s. He\u2019ll not only take care of your opposition, but He\u2019ll make it up to you. He\u2019s keeping the records. He knows what you\u2019re owed. It may not have been fair, but don\u2019t worry; payback is coming. God is going to make up for the wrongs that have been done to you. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"It's Payback Time\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/7WG8TCcbYm God is saying to you, \u201cI\u2019m going to repay you for the years the enemy has stolen, years you spent lonely, years you spent being mistreated. You\u2019re going to have plenty of joy, plenty of peace, plenty of resources, plenty of opportunities.\u201d The silence is not a sign that God is not working. He may not be changing the circumstances, but He is changing us. God uses the seasons of silence to get us prepared. To know George Bush was an honor. To call him our friend was a privilege. On behalf of our family, and Lakewood Church, we offer our most heartfelt prayers to the Bush family and to all of those who love and admire President Bush as much as we do.  - Joel and Victoria Victoria and I, along with the entire Osteen family, are deeply saddened at the passing of President Bush. He was a great man who served our nation with dignity, wisdom, and compassion, and inspired generations of Americans to do the same. God already knows everything about us. We\u2019re not hiding anything. He knows our weaknesses, our fears, our doubts. You don\u2019t have to have it all together. You\u2019re a work in progress. God\u2019s not finished with you. Whatever is trying to stop you, a mountain of debt, a mountain of sickness, a mountain of depression, a mountain of addiction, it may look insurmountable to you, but it\u2019s no match for our God. One touch of His favor, and He\u2019ll turn that mountain into level ground. God knows who you are. You are forgiven; you are redeemed. Take off the mask; quit pretending. God will mold you into a vessel of honor.  Check out \"Be Vulnerable\" on Podcast here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/b4PlptIoQ6 Every thought will tell you, \u201cYou have a reason to be bitter; it\u2019s never going to work out.\u201d Don\u2019t dwell on those lies. You wouldn\u2019t be here unless God had something amazing in front of you. He has a purpose for you to fulfill. The reason some people don\u2019t get along with other people is they don\u2019t get along with themselves. You have to be at peace with yourself before you can have peace with others. If you\u2019re hard on yourself, you\u2019ll be hard on them. Too often we sit on the sidelines, nursing our wounds. But the God who created the universe is about to pick you up, breathe new life into your dreams and propel you toward your destiny. The way you refuel is through your praise, by finding something to be grateful for, by not dwelling on what\u2019s wrong, but instead, thanking God for what\u2019s right. You don\u2019t have to have it all together.  You\u2019re a work in progress.  What He started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cBe Vulnerable\". Get it here:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/0tSSXwSbA5 God sees what\u2019s happening. He knows your circumstances, He knows what wasn\u2019t fair, He knows who walked away, and He knows how to make it up to you. God knows how to pay you back. He knows how to bring you out better. Let it go and trust God to be your vindicator. When you go through life at peace and in faith, knowing that God is surrounding what\u2019s surrounding you, you\u2019re showing God that you trust Him. That\u2019s what allows Him to show Himself strong in your life. Be at peace with not being perfect. You\u2019re not a finished product. God is still working on you. If you\u2019re not vulnerable, you\u2019ll stop growing. Click here to listen to, \"Be Vulnerable\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/RWZ4t5p5Rh God doesn\u2019t condemn you. He doesn\u2019t make you feel guilty. This is a new day. Take off the mask; quit pretending. If you do this, you\u2019ll rise higher, overcome every obstacle, and become everything God created you to be. In our weaknesses, God\u2019s strength shows up the greatest. Take the pressure off.

There are no perfect people. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Be Vulnerable\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/W7Y5MgyvQr If you pretend like you don\u2019t have weaknesses, then God\u2019s power isn\u2019t going to show up. When we pretend, when we try to impress people and live for our image, that puts pressure on us. Take off the mask. You can be real. You don\u2019t have to have everything figured out. When you\u2019re honest with God about your doubts, your shortcomings, your fears, that\u2019s not a weakness; that\u2019s a strength. God is not waiting for the perfect you, for the cleaned up you, the pretend you. He\u2019s waiting for the real you, the vulnerable you.  Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"Be Vulnerable\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/5jc4l9tcW1 There\u2019s a freedom when you can come to God honestly and openly, knowing that He doesn\u2019t judge you, He doesn\u2019t condemn you, He\u2019s not finding fault. He has mercy for every mistake, grace for every weakness, faith for every fear. When you\u2019re always thinking about God\u2019s goodness, how He\u2019s promoted you, vindicated you, protected you, not only will faith rise in your heart, but that attitude of expectancy is what allows God to turn things around. God doesn\u2019t let us be comfortable all the time. There will be seasons of stretching, growing, where we\u2019re not getting our way, the wrong thing is happening. The good news is God gives you strength for every battle, grace for every season. Don\u2019t let what once was a miracle become ordinary. Don\u2019t lose the awe of what God has done. Every chance you get, remember what God has done in your life. Talk about His greatness, not bragging on you, but bragging on God. Who can stop our God? Do you think that trouble at work is bigger, that sickness is stronger, those people are more powerful? They are pawns in the hands of God. Check out \"Pulled Strings\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/bGIXcM8Y7V God wouldn\u2019t have you there if you didn\u2019t need it. It may not be good, but He knows how to use it for your good. If you\u2019re there, don\u2019t fight it. Embrace it. Stay in peace. Don\u2019t wait until everything is good to give God thanks. Find the good along the way. Thank Him for the small things. If you\u2019ll be grateful for the good, God will get you to the very good. Victoria and I wish you and your family a very blessed Thanksgiving! The way to have continual joy is to keep a song of praise in your heart. All through the day we should have a grateful attitude. In our thoughts, we\u2019re always thinking about God\u2019s goodness. You don\u2019t know what God is up to. If He showed you the blueprint, if you could see into your future, it would amaze you.

The trauma indicates transition is on the way. God never brings you out the same. He\u2019s birthing you into something greater. More than ever, this is the time to live joyfully. Be a part of the solution. Bring some cheer into the world. Put a smile on your face. The One who drew up the blueprint for your life is not limited by the natural; He\u2019s supernatural.

He simply pulls the string. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Pulled Strings\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/RVffSjdzPf God is in control, not just of your life, but He\u2019s in control of your enemies. In difficult times, you need to remind yourself that God is still working according to His will. Your steps are still being ordered. When Moses asked God His name, He said, \u201cMy name is I Am.\u201d He was saying, \u201cI am everything. I am protection. I am strength. I am healing. I am provision. I am deliverance. I am wisdom. I am favor.\u201d Nothing can stand against our God. The scripture says, \u201cGod works all things according to His will.\u201d It\u2019s not according to who likes you or how much talent you have. It\u2019s according to His will. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"Pulled Strings\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/CdPRhfZGEW You don\u2019t have to worry about your future. Your life is divinely orchestrated. God has determined the end from the beginning. He\u2019s already laid out the plan, drawn up the blueprint. He knows everything that\u2019s going happen. Are you looking back with gratitude or are you looking back bitter, wondering why did it happen? Have a new perspective. The scar means you\u2019re healed. The scar means you\u2019re forgiven. The scar means you can walk again. Don\u2019t take the people in your life for granted. Let this be a wake-up call. Life is too short to live at odds with people. Human nature is to treat people like they\u2019re treating us, but all that\u2019s going to do is make matters worse. Rise above it. It\u2019s very powerful when you can say, \u201cI worship a Savior who has scars.

Life is too short to live offended, not forgiving, bitter over what didn\u2019t work out. God is not displeased with us because we have weaknesses. He\u2019s displeased when we\u2019re not using what He\u2019s given us. God wouldn\u2019t ask you to do something if He had not already given you what you need. God sees what\u2019s happening. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair and He knows how to make it up to you. Let it go and trust God. Bitterness will keep you from your destiny. It\u2019s going to pull you down into depression, steal your dreams, and rob you of your joy. You may have a good reason to be bitter, somebody hurt you, but holding on to the hurt is only going to make it worse. Our God can take an ugly wound, a painful loss, an unexpected illness, and somehow change it into something beautiful. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cPeace With Your Scars\".

Suddenly, the problem will turn around; suddenly, you\u2019ll be out of debt; suddenly, you\u2019ll meet the right person. God will do what you couldn\u2019t do.

Sometimes you have to let the other person think they\u2019re right, even when you know they\u2019re wrong, just for the sake of peace. Forgive the people that did you wrong. They hurt you once; don\u2019t let them continue to hurt you. They can\u2019t stop your destiny unless you allow them to.

But what you can\u2019t see is God is working behind the scenes. What He promised you, He still has every intention of bringing it to pass. God\u2019s not here to condemn us and make us feel bad about ourselves. But He will convict us and challenge us to come up higher. Condemnation pushes us down; conviction is there to push us up. It may not be fair, but God sees what\u2019s happening. He has you in the palm of His hand. He\u2019s given you grace for every frustration. He\u2019s breathing in your direction right now. Don\u2019t quit. You\u2019re close to the breakthrough; you\u2019re close to the new beginning. When you go the extra mile to keep strife out, walk away from an argument, you\u2019re not being weak. That\u2019s a sign of strength. It\u2019s not who\u2019s right that\u2019s important; it\u2019s what\u2019s right. What\u2019s right is to keep the peace. When you\u2019re a peacemaker, you\u2019re blessed. Could it be that what\u2019s frustrating you is really the hand of God? He\u2019s guiding you, protecting you, positioning you, preparing you.

No person, no boss, no company can stand against Him. He determines how high you\u2019re going to go. He sees what\u2019s going on. He knows what\u2019s not fair. It would be so much easier if God would give us specifics, but that wouldn\u2019t take any faith. Can you endure the silence of not knowing everything? Will you take that step of faith even though you\u2019re not sure how it\u2019s going to work out? Quit relying on people and go to God.

You can\u2019t go forward if you\u2019re always looking back. You can\u2019t see the new things God has in store if you\u2019re focused on what\u2019s behind. Start feeding your destiny. You have to recognize God is doing a new thing. You\u2019re growing; you\u2019re coming up higher. Discomfort is a sign that you\u2019re going to a new level. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"Sleep On\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/V93LYOqlGA The real victory is not when God does everything you want, takes away every frustration. The real victory is when those things happen, but it doesn\u2019t bother you anymore. You\u2019re at peace. You know God is still in control. You may think, \u201cWhat if I fail? What if I don\u2019t have the funds? What if they say no?\u201d You\u2019ll never know unless you try. When you come to the end of life, will you have more regrets from the risks that you took or from the risks that you didn\u2019t take? You may have seen His blessings in the past, but you haven\u2019t touched the surface of what He has in store. The scripture says, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen, heard, or imagined the amazing things God has for those that love Him.\u201d Don\u2019t be hard headed and keep going through the same pain again and again. You\u2019re doing yourself a disservice to go through a painful time and not come out with what you were supposed to gain. There\u2019s a lesson in the pain. Don\u2019t keep repeating the same mistakes. Keep your shoulders back; live with confidence. You have an advantage; the blessing is on your life.  Check out \"The Power of the Blessing\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/VWGFKQBaXl God is not looking for the ideal you, the pretend you, the future you. He\u2019s looking for the real you. Be real. That\u2019s the kind of people God promotes. There\u2019s power in vulnerability. There\u2019s a freedom when you can come to God honest and open, knowing that He doesn\u2019t judge you. God doesn\u2019t condemn you. He\u2019s not finding fault. He has mercy for every mistake, grace for every weakness, faith for every fear. Pain will change us. How the pain changes you is up to you. You can come out bitter, or you can come out better. Don\u2019t just go through it; grow through it. There is purpose in your pain. From the time God puts the promise in your heart until it comes to pass, that\u2019s called the trial of your faith. That\u2019s when it\u2019s easy to get discouraged. Keep praying; keep believing. It may not have happened yet, but what God promised you, He\u2019s going to bring to pass. The blessing is why that setback is not the end; it\u2019s a setup for what God is about to do. Don\u2019t get upset when life is not fair. The blessing is still on you. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cThe Power of the Blessing\". Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/fyKqKloYBZ Don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period. Every piece of your life has already been fitted, planned, and designed. When you face opposition, when people try to stop you, you don\u2019t have to get upset, try to get even, or worry about how it\u2019s going to work out. You can stay in peace knowing that when they come against you, they are touching God\u2019s anointed. We hope you'll make plans for our next Night of Hope!

Click here to listen to, \"The Power of the Blessing\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kdsJtQeeST It\u2019s not your battle; the battle is the Lord\u2019s. He\u2019s your defender. He\u2019s your vindicator, your healer, your provider, your way maker. People don\u2019t determine your destiny. What they say about you doesn\u2019t stop your purpose. The bad breaks, the unfair situations, they don\u2019t have the final say. The blessing on your life will always override what\u2019s trying to stop you. @AmeliasTreasure You are very important to us. Our team will be praying for your family. You can also post your prayer request here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK -JOM Team God is going before you making crooked places straight, moving the wrong people out of the way, arranging things in your favor.  Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"The Power of the Blessing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/KhdfRXaFf0 When you know you have the blessing, you don\u2019t live upset because people aren\u2019t treating you right, worried about your finances, frustrated over the medical report. You stay in peace. You know God being for you is more than the world being against you. The scripture says what God has blessed no one can curse. The blessing on you is more powerful than any betrayal, than any negative word spoken over you, than how you were raised, than people trying to discredit you. You are blessed in the city and blessed in the country.  You are blessed when things are going your way and blessed when they\u2019re not going your way. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"The Power of the Blessing\"! https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/Py8rbqdsy6 God said in Psalms, \u201cTouch not My anointed.\u201d You are His anointed. When people come against you, they\u2019re not just messing with you; they\u2019re messing with the God who put His blessing on you. What God has blessed no person can curse. God promised that He\u2019ll arm you with strength for every battle. We may not know what the future holds, but we know Who holds the future. When you go the extra mile to keep strife out, you walk away when you feel like arguing, you\u2019re not being weak. That\u2019s a sign of strength. The most mature person is the one that walks away from the argument. If you will put yourself in an environment with friends that challenge and inspire you, with people that push you up, then those seeds will take root, and you will begin to blossom. Get around dreamers, connect with people that are more talented, and glean from them. Join us in Toronto for a Night of Hope, Friday, November 30 @ScotiabankArena!

Your faith is going to bring freedom, promotion, breakthroughs, abundance, the fullness of your destiny. Check out \"Your Faith\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/lnOwlnFlBo God chose you because He knew you could handle it. You have the courage, strength, anointing, and favor. You\u2019re not weak or lacking. You are full of \u2018can do\u2019 power. You didn\u2019t come this far to give up. The people that see dreams come to pass are the people that stay committed. You may have plenty of reasons to give up on your dream, think it\u2019s never going to work out. You\u2019ve had disappointments, setbacks. That\u2019s all a part of the process. When you get knocked down, you have to get back up again. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. Are you living with expectancy knowing that God\u2019s bigger than your problems, greater than that sickness, more powerful than that addiction? Don't miss \"Your Faith\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/2ceIzlQzHP You may have enemies coming against you but you have an advantage, God has placed you out of reach. They can\u2019t defeat you, they can\u2019t keep you from your destiny. Stay confident. Keep your peace. Sometimes the reason we\u2019re frustrated is we\u2019re trying to change things that only God can change. You can\u2019t make people do what\u2019s right. You can pray for them, you can encourage them, but they have their own free will. Don\u2019t let them steal your joy. It may seem too far out, like it could never happen. That\u2019s God speaking to you. His dream for your life is so much bigger than your own. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cYour Faith\". Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/7A5rQhU4vP God has the final say. It may have been meant for your harm, but instead of being a stumbling block, God will turn it into a stepping-stone to take you to the next level. If you\u2019re going to reach your highest potential, you have to stay committed. Make up your mind that you\u2019re in it for the long haul. It may be difficult, you may have a good reason to walk away, but don\u2019t take the easy way out. @davidcrank @yourfaithchurch Looking forward to being there with you all! Your faith is going to make you whole. Your faith is going to break the addiction. Your faith is going to help you accomplish your dreams. Your faith is going to take you further than you\u2019ve imagined. Click here to listen to, \"Your Faith\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/VY9y0QEgue You have to walk by faith and not by sight. Keep expecting it. Keep talking like it\u2019s going to happen, acting like it\u2019s going to happen, thinking like it\u2019s going to happen. Release your faith. Your faith is going to take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own. When God sees you doing your part, believing when you don\u2019t see any sign of it, thanking Him when you\u2019re weak, taking steps of faith when you\u2019re uncomfortable, God will give you strength beyond your natural ability. He\u2019ll help you do what you normally couldn\u2019t do. We're excited to be in Hershey, PA for our next Night of Hope Friday, November 2 @ Giant Center! We hope you'll join us! Click here for details: https://t.co/4GU650bdsn https://t.co/OTzAZhBiAe You\u2019ve been praying, believing, expecting for a long time. Stay in faith; it\u2019s on the way. You\u2019re closer than you think. It\u2019s going to happen sooner than it looks. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Your Faith\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EoT3wZjWIg You have to be willing to leave some things behind if you\u2019re going to become all you were created to be. Maybe you need to leave bitterness, leave compromise, leave the hurt. God whispers in your spirit dreams and promises: what you can become. The enemy will try to drown them out. He\u2019ll use people to try to discourage you. No matter how loud they are, don\u2019t let them talk you out of what God has whispered in your spirit. Why don\u2019t you release your faith? Your faith can activate God's power. Your faith can be the catalyst for God to do amazing things. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"Your Faith\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/V1s2SwQnSi There\u2019s nothing more powerful than your faith. When you believe, when you expect things to change, when you know what God started He will finish, when you live with expectancy, that\u2019s what activates His power. When you\u2019re honest with God, when you\u2019re real, He doesn\u2019t turn away. He comes to you. You don\u2019t have to hide your doubts, hide your fears. God already knows everything about you. He knows how you feel. God\u2019s ways are not our ways; His plan is better than our plan. Don\u2019t fight the valleys. Stay in faith. Every disappointment, every bad break that\u2019s not a surprise to God. That valley is an opportunity for God to take you to a new level. You will be your most productive, your most effective, not when you\u2019re working all the time, not when you\u2019re putting in the most hours, but when you\u2019re balanced physically, spiritually, and emotionally. If you neglect one area, it will lessen what you could accomplish. Are you trying to earn God\u2019s love: work hard enough, be good enough? Why don\u2019t you start believing you\u2019re His son, His daughter. You\u2019re already in the family. Check out  \"A Son Mentality\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/JMSBOKuks8 When you have doubts and questions, don\u2019t get down on yourself. God\u2019s not disappointed in you. When you\u2019re honest with God about your doubts, your shortcomings, your fears, that\u2019s not a weakness; that\u2019s a strength. If you can\u2019t be honest with yourself, if you have to hide your struggles, try to cover your weaknesses, that\u2019s going to keep you from your potential. God is not looking for the ideal you, the pretend you, the future you. He\u2019s looking for the real you. You have to know who you are and Who you belong to. Fear doesn\u2019t have any right to you. It doesn\u2019t own you. Don't miss \"A Son Mentality\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nXepq56Gf2 God never said we would understand everything along the way. He didn\u2019t promise that there wouldn\u2019t be any pain, suffering, disappointments. But He did promise that it would all work out for our good. God is not just with you on the mountaintops, He\u2019s with you in the valleys when you\u2019re going through things. He knows what you\u2019re up against. The Scripture says He\u2019s concerned about what concerns you. I\u2019m excited for you to hear my son @JonathanOsteen. He\u2019s really amazing. He talks about the different seasons in life and how to embrace each one knowing that it\u2019s necessary and working for our good.\n\nFull message is available on the #JoelOsteenPodcast  https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/b9l6WPOoFU We all go through difficulties, setbacks, loss. Pain is a part of life. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged and think, \u201cGod, why did this happen?\u201d But one of the best things I\u2019ve learned is: don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period. Believe that God wants to be good to you. Ask Him for your dreams. Pray bold prayers. You\u2019re not inconveniencing Him. You don\u2019t have to earn His love; you don\u2019t have to work for His approval. If you believe the lie that you\u2019ve reached your limits, that you\u2019ll always struggle, that\u2019s going to keep you from your destiny. Click here to listen to, \"A Son Mentality\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/TTUCIa7dee You may have enemies coming against you but you have an advantage, God has placed you out of reach. They can\u2019t defeat you; they can\u2019t keep you from your destiny. Stay confident. Keep your peace. God not only freed you from sin, from addictions, from guilt, from sickness, but he took care of your enemy. Your oppressor has been defeated. The enemy has no power over you. Make plans for our next Night of Hope on Friday, October 12 at @TheQArena in Cleveland, OH. Click here for details: https://t.co/sqb1SRVOTI https://t.co/3VFOzMgrFH Sometimes what\u2019s holding us back is we don\u2019t know who we are. We are sons and daughters of the Most High God. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"A Son Mentality\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kpIf0MmhHh Don\u2019t think about what you were, what you\u2019ve been through, the mistakes you\u2019ve made. Start thinking about who you are. You are free. You are blessed. You are a masterpiece. You are favored. You are a child of Almighty God. We all have negative things we don\u2019t understand, but God has beauty for ashes. He has new beginnings; He has mercy for mistakes. Nothing that\u2019s happened in your past, nothing that you\u2019ve done has to stop the good things God has in store. The scripture says, \u201cCome boldly to the throne of grace.\" Go to Him with boldness. Go to Him like He\u2019s proud of you, like you deserve to be there. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"A Son Mentality\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/TMbKN7PJLP Don\u2019t be a slave to your past. Quit reliving the hurts. Quit dwelling on your mistakes. This is a new day. If you\u2019ll let go of the old, you\u2019ll move into the new things God has in store. Sometimes we forget the good things. We remember the hurts, the disappointments, the mistakes. But, look where you are now. If it had not been for the goodness of God, you wouldn\u2019t be here. You can\u2019t have a big testimony without a big test. Sometimes, God will send a big enemy. Stay in faith. They can\u2019t stop His plan for you. God is going to use them as fuel for your destiny. You\u2019ll live a lot freer and a lot happier if you\u2019ll quit fighting what God is not changing. Don't get upset over what He\u2019s not removing. God has given you the grace to be there with a good attitude. Get ready; you\u2019re about to know the Lord is on your side. What He\u2019s done in the past is going to pale in comparison to what He\u2019s about to do. Check out \"By This I Know\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/m1mXTUKyVo Every challenge God has brought you through, those victories were designed as fuel for your faith. So, when you face new challenges, you can look back and say, \u201cGod, You did it for me back then. I know You\u2019ll do it for me now.\u201d The environment that you put yourself in is extremely important. No matter how good a seed is, it\u2019s dependent on having good soil. You have to be selective with whom you give your time, energy, and attention. We've met some great people and heard some amazing stories!

He\u2019s keeping the records. The scripture says, \u201cPromotion doesn\u2019t come from the north or the south; it comes from the Lord.\u201d You can\u2019t have a new life with old thinking. Limited thinking will cause you to live a limited life. Start believing bigger. @GumalaD We encourage you to stay in faith. Our team will be praying for you. You can also post your prayer request here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK. -JOM Team Remember what God has done. Thank Him for the Red Seas He\u2019s parted. Thank Him for the giants you\u2019ve defeated.

Pray, believe, &amp; then leave it in His hands. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll get so focused on what you want that you\u2019ll miss the beauty of this day. Everything may not be perfect, there are things that need to change, but you have the grace to be happy today. You may go through a season of being lonely, but God will bring new friends, better friends: people that push you up and don't pull you down. People that challenge you to rise higher, not settle for mediocrity. God has not brought you this far to leave you. He defeated enemies for you in the past. The good news is He\u2019s still going to do it again in the future.

You need people in your life that are further along than you, people that have a bigger vision, people that are more experienced, people that are out of your league. You need to be exposed to new levels so that you can go to new levels! The things that should have stopped you, you\u2019re still standing. You\u2019re still blessed. You\u2019re still happy.

You\u2019re out of fuel; your faith needs to be re-energized. The way you do this is by remembering the times God made a way, the times He delivered you, the times He protected you. The enemy may do his best, but his best will never be enough. The forces that are for you are greater than the forces that are against you. Don\u2019t live worried and afraid.

Get it here: https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/rrQXcfHTfd We\u2019ve all come through challenges and difficulties that should have stopped us. That wasn\u2019t luck. It wasn\u2019t just a good break. That was the hand of God pushing back forces of darkness. You\u2019re right on schedule. That delay, detour, disappointment is a part of God\u2019s plan. Be patient and wait for His plan to unfold. Life is too short to go through it bitter, trying to get even. All that\u2019s doing is poisoning your life. Try a different approach and pray for your enemies. Bless those that curse you. God knows what He\u2019s doing. If He\u2019s asking you to wait, what He has in store is going to be bigger than what you have in mind. When you keep God on the throne, you\u2019ll be in peace when you should be panicked.

Your race is specifically for you. You\u2019re not in competition with your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, or your siblings. The only competition you have is with yourself, to be the best that you can be. The anointing on your life is to be who God called you to be. Be confident in who you are.

There are seasons of watering, planting, pulling up the weeds, and fertilizing. Are you doing the right thing when you\u2019re not seeing growth? Have faith and patience. God works where there\u2019s an attitude of faith. You can\u2019t have the medical report on the throne, living worried, upset, afraid, and have God on the throne at the same time.

God has people lined up that will bring out the best in you. We hope you'll make plans for our next Night of Hope on Saturday, October 6 at @CapitalOneArena in Washington, D.C.

He\u2019s going to make up for the wrongs. He has beauty for ashes. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"What's On Your Throne\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/yVqVQHZ0Q8 When you put God on the throne, He\u2019ll make a way where you don\u2019t see a way. He\u2019ll promote you when people try to hold you down. He\u2019ll give you beauty for those ashes. He\u2019ll restore you and bring you through the disappointment better than you were before. You have to be still and know that He is God. Take worry off the throne. Worry drains your energy, steals your joy, and takes your creativity. Start thanking God that He is sovereign, He reigns over those circumstances. Start dwelling on the greatness of our God. David said, \u201cI don\u2019t look to the mountains for help; I look to the God Who made the mountains.\u201d  Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"What's On Your Throne.\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/obYSTl26VM Sickness has a name, but there is a name that\u2019s higher. That problem maybe big, but it\u2019s no match for our God. Keep Him on the throne. Quit   thinking about how big your problem is and start thinking about how big your God is. The reason some people don\u2019t get along with other people is that they don\u2019t get along with themselves. You have to be at peace with yourself before you can have peace with others. If you\u2019re hard on yourself, you\u2019ll be hard on them. You can\u2019t let something negative spoken over you become a part of your recording. You have to get good at hitting the delete button. Quit dwelling on it; quit replaying it. They don\u2019t know what God put in you. Successful people are too busy running their race to look at what everybody else is doing. Quit comparing yourself. The way you see yourself is the way others see you.  When you criticize yourself, you\u2019re criticizing God\u2019s creation. Check out \"The Right Recording\" from Joel on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/21pKLm3GOg We can get so consumed with what we want that it becomes like an idol. Turn it over to God. Pray, believe, and then leave it in God\u2019s hands. Everything may not be perfect;  there are things that need to change, but you have the grace to be happy today. You don\u2019t need friends that only like you for what you can do for them instead of for who you are. Make a change and God will give you true friends.

If you\u2019re going to live in peace, you have to put some boundaries up and not allow everything in. When you\u2019re uncommon, when you don\u2019t compromise, when you don\u2019t take the easy way out, God will do the uncommon. He\u2019ll close the mouths of lions. He\u2019ll vindicate you. He\u2019ll promote you. Every person has negative words spoken over them. People will try to hold you back, discourage you. Delete the negative and become who God created you to be. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cThe Right Recording\". Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Bq8E5lyyDI We all have to deal with challenges and interact with people, but we\u2019re supposed to do this from a place of peace. That\u2019s a place where we know God is in control. Don't worry. One day, some of the people that are dismissing you, not giving you credit, trying to make you feel less than are going to want what you have. God is preparing a table before you in the presence of your enemies. When God created you, He stepped back and said, \u201cThat was very good.\u201d  You are fearfully and wonderfully made, a child of the Most High God.  Click here to listen to, \"The Right Recording\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/bsaGIirpuC God doesn\u2019t love you because you\u2019re \"religious\" or \"good enough\" or come from a certain family. He loves you because you are His child. He breathed His life into you. It\u2019s great when people believe in us, cheer us on and make us feel valuable. But here\u2019s the key: if you rely on people, you\u2019ll be disappointed. People will let you down. Your value, your self-worth doesn\u2019t come from another person, it comes from your Creator.

Words are like seeds. They have power. Delete the negative and become who God created you to be. Don\u2019t let what someone said cause you to feel less than. That\u2019s held you back long enough. It\u2019s time to put on a new recording, \u201cYou are equipped. You are empowered. You are anointed.\u201d The enemy wouldn\u2019t be trying to stop you if he didn\u2019t know something amazing was in your future.

You have enough people and circumstances against you; don\u2019t be against yourself. When the negative comes up, do yourself a favor and delete it. Switch over to the right recording. It\u2019s easy to let the pressures of life weigh us down. We have bills to pay, traffic to deal with, people that are rude. If we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll look up and see that we don\u2019t smile as much, we\u2019re not as friendly. Don\u2019t live with that heaviness. Choose to live full of joy. If you\u2019ll be sensitive to what you\u2019re hearing, the still small voice, the promptings, the suggestions, the alarms, then God will save you from heartache and pain. He\u2019ll lead you into promotion and favor. God knows what we can handle. Sometimes, in order to protect us, He\u2019ll say, \u201cNot yet.\u201d Don\u2019t fight it. Trust His timing. It\u2019s not how much you have, it\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with what you have. You have been crowned with favor. Get that dream out, release it and watch what God will do.

When you hear those voices telling you that you\u2019ve blown it, you missed your chance, that means you\u2019re listening to the wrong voices. When you know someone is cheering for you, it gives you an edge. You can run a little faster. You can jump a little higher. You can withstand a little more pressure.

The people that see promises fulfilled, the people that see breakthroughs are the people that keep praying, keep believing, and keep standing in faith. You don\u2019t meet people by accident.

Uncommon faith is not average faith. It\u2019s not ordinary. It\u2019s above and beyond. It gives you a boldness and a confidence to believe for the extraordinary. God is speaking to us.

You can have great faith, but if you\u2019re not listening to the still small voice, if you\u2019re ignoring what God is asking you to deal with, then it will keep you from your miracle.

Just as God opens doors, God closes doors. Don\u2019t get stuck trying to hold on to something that\u2019s over and done. God has the final say. He said the path of the righteous, your path, gets brighter and brighter.

Favor is in your future.\u201d When you have the commanded blessing, God will cause people to be good to you that have never been good to you. He\u2019ll move the wrong people out of your path.

But, here\u2019s the key, they are powerless to change the blessing on your life. God favored you so you could show people favor. He brought you through that loss; He gave you a new beginning so that you could help others. Don't miss \"From Patient to Physician\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/08lf4LdEQw You can\u2019t reach your highest potential on your own. What God has planned for you is going to take more than just your faith. You need people to lift you, to carry you, to push you further. It doesn\u2019t matter who likes you. What matters is that the Most High God likes you. He\u2019s not limited by who\u2019s against you. When He commands the blessing, all the forces of darkness cannot stop Him. As you give away what God has given you, as you strengthen others, you will always have the strength you need. Be inspired with this message from Joel, \u201cFrom Patient to Physician\u201d.

The two are tied together. You\u2019ve been blessed. Now, go be a blessing. You\u2019ve overcome that addiction; help someone else overcome. You\u2019ve been promoted; help someone else be promoted.

Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"From Patient to Physician\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/9n86nO3TIP It\u2019s not only about being good to others. The way you\u2019re going to keep your blessing is by being a blessing. The scripture says, \u201cGive, and it will be given unto you.\u201d Whatever God has brought you through, whatever He\u2019s turned around, whatever He\u2019s made happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen, that\u2019s an opportunity to help and strengthen someone else. Somebody encouraged you, somebody believed in you, somebody prayed for you. Take time to help someone else. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast, \"From Patient to Physician\": https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/z57B8Lcgfv It\u2019s not enough to just bask in what God has done. That\u2019s good, but you have a responsibility to help someone else in that same situation. You\u2019re no longer a patient; you\u2019ve become the physician. The promise God put in you is like a seed. The seed has to be watered. The way you water it is through your praise, by thanking God that it\u2019s coming, by having an attitude of expectancy. Life is too short to waste your valuable time with the wrong people. To reach your highest potential, you have to surround yourself with eagles, with people that push you forward, people that make you better, people that help you to soar. Some things God has in your future, if He gave them to you right now, you couldn\u2019t handle it. He loves you too much to let it happen. @Sareoso Thank you, we appreciate you! -JOM Team @pradeepgreen30 Our team will be praying for you.

Check out \"Knowing You Are Loved\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/KL46mCKHPM Religion tells you to clean yourself up, then God will love you, but that\u2019s not real love. That\u2019s conditional love. Real love is not dependent on how much you love Him; it\u2019s about how much He loves you. You have to give people the grace to change. Don\u2019t judge their whole life on one season, one mistake. Real love is not our love for God; it\u2019s God\u2019s love for us. Take the pressure off and receive the real love, His love for you. Don't miss \"Knowing You Are Loved\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Cb19D3eS3j You can\u2019t bring yesterday\u2019s failures into today and live a life of victory. Let it go. God\u2019s mercy is fresh every morning. The closed doors, the delays, whatever it is, keep the right perspective. It\u2019s all good. God allowed it; He\u2019s going to use it. Go to God with confidence, pray bold prayers, ask him for your dreams, and expect new doors to open. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cKnowing You Are Loved\u201d.

You\u2019re someone that God can entrust with greatness. He can use you for His highest purposes. We\u2019ve all made mistakes, but you don\u2019t have to pay God back. The price has already been paid. Receive His forgiveness; receive His mercy. You have enough people in life against you. Don\u2019t be against yourself.

You have a defender, not somebody average or mediocre, the Most High God is representing you. It doesn\u2019t bring God pleasure when we go around feeling unworthy, inferior. Shake that off and start going boldly to the throne. God doesn\u2019t just show love, express love; He is love. It's not what He does; it\u2019s who He is. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast: \"Knowing You Are Loved\"! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/CYyx7mJEhU We think about how much we love God, but what\u2019s more profound is how much God loves you. He took the time to plan out all of your days. He knows your thoughts before you think them, your words before you speak them. You were created to stand out, to be a cut above. Now, do your part and distinguish yourself. The pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret. Don\u2019t be moved by what\u2019s not working out, by how long it\u2019s taking, by who\u2019s not for you. The Most High God is for you! Don\u2019t worry about being in the right group, having the most friends, being the most popular. It\u2019s not the quantity of friends that\u2019s important; it\u2019s the quality of your friends. It may not be easy, but your destiny is calling. You have greatness in you. Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it; don\u2019t let circumstances convince you that you can\u2019t.

Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"How Bad Do You Want It?\" https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/IfpyTeD2S4 As a father, when you tell your child how proud you are, how much they mean to you, it can do something major in their life. The blessing of the father can release your children into a new level of their destiny. Give your children your blessing. Tell them what they can become. Sometimes your enemies will do more to promote you than your friends. They thought they were going to stop you, discourage you, intimidate you, but they didn\u2019t realize God used them to light a fire on the inside. They meant it for harm, but God used them to your advantage. Don\u2019t spend another minute down on yourself, living in regrets. God has forgiven you; forgive yourself. He\u2019s not condemning you. He\u2019s not pushing you down. Don't push yourself down. Don\u2019t get stuck at the well of argument. Let God be your vindicator. Let Him fight your battles. He will vindicate you better than you can vindicate yourself. @HellenMedAppeal God is our healer and our restorer.

Sometimes the reason God is not changing the circumstances is because He\u2019s using the circumstances to change us. The blessing is not on your location; the blessing is on you.

Instead of getting upset with them, remember that opposition is a sign that God has something greater, something that you haven\u2019t seen.

We all have opposition; we all have people that come against us. If you\u2019ll keep moving forward, you\u2019ll see God vindicate you, promote you, and take you where you could not go on your own.

They know God is in control. They know that the setback is really a setup for God to do something greater. God doesn\u2019t waste anything we go through. He uses it to get us prepared for where He\u2019s taking us. Life will try to make you feel like you\u2019re not worthy. Despite what thoughts are telling you, despite who said you weren\u2019t good enough, you have to remind yourself, \u201cI am worthy. I am a masterpiece, I am wonderfully made.\u201d Just because you gave up doesn\u2019t mean God gave up. Remember your dream. Remember what God promised you.

You don\u2019t need their approval; you have Almighty God\u2019s approval. When you take the high road, when you\u2019re an eagle, some people may mistake that for weakness, but the truth is that\u2019s a sign of strength. It takes a strong person to overlook an offense.

Sometimes we\u2019re putting pressure on people to keep us fixed, keep us encouraged, keep us complimented. Let them off the hook. They\u2019re not your savior. You have a Savior. Go to Him and not to people. Hold your head up high. Start carrying yourself with confidence. You have been fearfully and wonderfully made. Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Recognizing Your Value\" https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/Njpxn8WKAa Too often we base our value on how somebody is treating us, or how successful we are, or how perfect of a life we live. The problem is that all of those things can change. Here\u2019s the key, your value should be based solely on the fact that you are a child of the Most High God. You\u2019re not stuck, you haven\u2019t reached your limits. As you keep honoring God, at the right time, you\u2019re going to go where you couldn\u2019t go before. You\u2019re going to accomplish more than you can imagine. There\u2019s always something trying to pull us out of peace, pull us out of rest. Don't let it move you.  Live from a deeper place and stay in peace. The problem with a \u201cone day\u201d mentality is that you\u2019ll miss what God wants to do today. God wants to give you favor right here, right now. You can live from a place of peace, a place of rest knowing that God is not only fighting your battles, but He\u2019s lined up the breaks you need. Check out \"Just One Good Break\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ikk7cKhm1y As long as you\u2019re allowing circumstances to determine whether or not you\u2019re going to be happy, then you\u2019re never going to have real victory. Every unfair situation, every delay and closed door are not setbacks; they\u2019re setups for God to get you to where He wants you to be. Quit focusing on who\u2019s not for you and start focusing on who is for you\u2014the Most High God. Don't miss \"Just One Good Break\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/CcjkTmo2RL You are just one good break away from God catapulting you to a new level. Just one right person showing you favor, and it will change the course of your life. Your dream may be buried, but the good news is, it\u2019s still alive. It\u2019s not too late to see it come to pass. The key to reaching your destiny is that you have to remember your dream. Remember what God promised you. You don\u2019t have to go after the blessing, keep honoring God and the blessing will come to you. Be inspired with this message from Joel, \u201cJust One Good Break\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/8lBH4q2FbO The Most High God, the Creator of the universe, the one who flung stars into space is breathing in your direction. Him being for you is more than the world being against you. Without being faithful and proving to God that you could be trusted, you wouldn\u2019t be ready for where He\u2019s taking you. You have to be prepared for what God has in store. We're excited to be in Indianapolis Friday, August 10 at @TheFieldhouse for our Night of Hope! Reserve your seat here: https://t.co/oerWd6JVpL https://t.co/e9HtGVJZsh When something doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s because God has something better in store. You may not be able to see it at the time, but that\u2019s when you have to trust Him. Click here to listen to, \u201cJust One Good Break\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xZHTJcYiim Here\u2019s a key: you don\u2019t want what\u2019s not supposed to be yours. If it\u2019s not supposed to be yours, you\u2019re not going to have the grace for it. Get ready; God\u2019s about to surprise you. He\u2019s already spoken to the right people. He\u2019s already lined up the healing, the freedom, the promotion. It\u2019s going to happen suddenly, when you didn\u2019t see it coming. @mawxee God is our healer and our restorer. Let us pray with you here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK -JOM Team You can live from a place of peace, a place of rest knowing that God is not only fighting your battles, but He has solutions to problems that you can\u2019t see.

He\u2019s promised to work out His plan for your life. His plan is better than your plan. Give God something to work with. Pitch your tent in the land of hope. Get up every morning with expectancy, knowing that He\u2019s working out His plan for your life. Do yourself a favor, pull up your stakes, pick up your tent and move out of the land of doubt, the land of it-can\u2019t-happen. Pitch your tent in the land of with-God-all-things-are-possible!  Watch Joel\u2019s new message this morning on Podcast! \"Just One Good Break\" https://t.co/4r2gg87uze Are you steadfast, immovable, do your roots go down deep? If not, life is going to be like a rollercoaster. God is saying, be steadfast, be immovable. When you face difficulties, more than ever, you need to keep your mind filled with thoughts of faith, surround yourself with people that will speak life and hope, people that will agree with what you're believing for. The Psalmist said, \u201cIf you go to the depths of the ocean or high up in the heavens, God will be right there.\u201d You can\u2019t get away from Him. In the dark times, when life feels unfair, you have to remind yourself that God is still in control. Refuse to worry. Instead, thank Him that He\u2019s fighting your battles. We are deeply saddened to hear about the shooting at Santa Fe High School here in Texas. Please join us in praying for peace and healing for the students, their families, the faculty and all those affected. #PrayforSantaFe https://t.co/NhZ72wIGy4 When we're not obedient and get off course, God doesn\u2019t give up on us. He\u2019s full of mercy. You can turn your back on Him, but He won\u2019t turn His back on you. What you\u2019re believing for is not way off in the distance; it\u2019s not years down the road. It\u2019s at hand; it\u2019s close. Live with expectancy. God says restoration is coming, new beginnings are coming, breakthroughs, abundance, and victory are coming. Get your hopes up. God has something amazing in front of you!

When you know that God is still on the throne and that He has beauty for ashes, then deep down you\u2019ll feel a peace; you\u2019ll be at rest. Don\u2019t wake up thinking about the haters; wake up thinking about the goodness of God. Be inspired with this message from Joel, \u201cManasseh Is Coming\u201d. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/n9f0YZjETk God didn\u2019t base His plan for your life on you making perfect decisions. God has a plan even for our mistakes. Don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period. We\u2019re not going to understand everything that happens, but God is going to cause you to forget the pain of the past.

The difficulties are temporary; joy is permanent. There will be a day where God is going to cause you to forget.  You\u2019re not going to wake up thinking about who hurt you; you\u2019re going to wake up thinking about how blessed you are. God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. He\u2019s seen the heartache, the lonely nights, the injustice. God has collected every tear you\u2019ve shed. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Manasseh Is Coming\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/SChvSML9Q9 God doesn\u2019t promise that we won\u2019t have trouble. Sometimes we\u2019ll have a double dose, more than our fair share. But the good news is that trouble doesn\u2019t have the final say. The betrayal, the sickness, the loss is not how your story ends. The scripture says your joy will go on forever. That means the trouble is not permanent, the pain is not permanent, the loneliness, the addiction, the depression is not going to last. God wants to bless you in such a way that you don\u2019t remember the pain of the past.

He has something that you\u2019ve never seen, something more rewarding, more fulfilling than you\u2019ve ever dreamed. Dare to trust Him not just when things are going your way, not just when He\u2019s meeting your demands, fulfilling your desires, but even when you don\u2019t understand. When you stay in peace, that\u2019s a place of power. If you don\u2019t have peace on the inside, you won\u2019t have peace on the outside. He may not stop every plot of the enemy, every betrayal, every injustice but He will use it to move you into your destiny. Get your fire back, get your passion back.

Sometimes we think God is not answering our prayers, but He is answering them; He\u2019s just not doing it the way we want.

Don\u2019t go through the day disappointed. This is the day the Lord has made. He\u2019s on the throne. When you have deep roots, you\u2019re grateful to be alive. You\u2019re not focused on what\u2019s wrong; you\u2019re thanking God for what\u2019s right. No person can stop Him, no crisis, no delay.

It may not make sense, it wasn\u2019t fair, but God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it wasn\u2018t going to work for your good.

If you\u2019ll stay in faith, all things are going to work for your good. Don\u2019t get discouraged when you don\u2019t understand it. God is up to something. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"It's a Setup\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Jh9pVhm2Y1 The scripture says, \u201cGod has ordered your steps.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say He suggested them\u2014no\u2014your steps have been ordered. What God orders will come to pass. You are not at the mercy of fate, of luck, of happenstance, of other people. The God who flung the stars into space, the God who causes the earth to rotate down to the exact millisecond has ordered your steps. God will give grace, strength, favor and joy that lifts you, sustains you and takes you through things that should have stopped you. Do you think another person can stop what God has ordered for you?  The enemy thinks he\u2019s using them to hold you back. The truth is, God is using them to push you forward. Watch Joel\u2019s new message, \"It's a Setup\" this morning on Podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/o5SHpWLGip God has a plan for our mistakes. That\u2019s how amazing He is. He knows how to bring good even when we fail. Run after the hurting, go after the broken, the addicted, those that have messed up, that society has written off.  Go after them with love, with mercy, with the goodness of God. Our decisions don\u2019t just affect us, they affect our family, our children, and our friends. If you don\u2019t do the right thing for yourself, at least do it for your children, do it for your family.

He knew every mistake you would make, and He\u2019s already calculated a new route. You can still fulfill God\u2019s best plan for your life. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

He doesn\u2019t turn His back when we make mistakes. Just the opposite. He comes running to us. Take time to make a difference. Don\u2019t look through eyes of judgment; look through eyes of love.

He loves broken people, people that are at a disadvantage, not just people that have just had a bad break. God loves people that got themselves into the mess. Go after someone that\u2019s made mistakes, someone that\u2019s hurting, someone that doesn\u2019t deserve it. You can be the one that helps get them back on their feet. It\u2019s easy to criticize, but you don\u2019t know where you would be if you had walked in their shoes. Get this new message from Joel, \"Remove the Grave Clothes\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/J2YYoxjPUU Instead of judging people, why don\u2019t you take that same time to pray for them, to reach out to them, to let them know that you believe in them. Don\u2019t judge by appearance. Underneath the mess, there\u2019s a free person, a clean person, a forgiven person, an exceptional person, a victorious person.

God is counting on us to lift the fallen, to restore the broken, to heal the hurting. You may not see it at the time, but God knows what He\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not random. It\u2019s a part of His plan. Dare to trust Him. You have a destiny to fulfill. You have an assignment to accomplish. Don\u2019t waste your valuable time on something that\u2019s not moving you toward your purpose. Are you frustrated because something is not going your way. You\u2019ll live a lot freer and a lot happier if you\u2019ll quit fighting what God is not changing. He is giving you the grace to be there with a good attitude. God is looking for uncommon people.

Check out \"Uncommon\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/KZMDWKpyq0 When others shrink back, have uncommon faith. When others take the easy way out, have uncommon commitment. When others slack off, have uncommon excellence. Some things are better left unsaid. You don\u2019t have to win every argument or comment on every situation. Just bite your tongue and let it go.

Trust Him when you don\u2019t understand. Trust Him when it feels like you\u2019re going to the wrong way. You\u2019re not like everyone else. The Most High God has not only handpicked you, He not only chose you, but He set you apart. He made you uncommon. You\u2019re not everybody. You\u2019re the exception. The scripture says, \u201cYou\u2019ve been set apart. You are a chosen people.\u201d That\u2019s saying, you\u2019re not common. Click here to listen to \u201cUncommon\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/KtgHrSGVAr It takes courage to be different. It takes courage to not compromise.

It doesn\u2019t take much effort to do what everyone else is doing. A dead fish can float downstream; it takes a live one to swim upstream. It\u2019s easy to be common.

They\u2019re committed, they're faithful, they\u2019re excellent. For every struggle, every temptation, every difficulty, God has given you the grace to stand strong.

What hasn\u2019t worked out in the past is suddenly going to fall into place. More than ever, this is the time to live joyfully. Be a part of the solution. Bring some cheer into the world. Put a smile on your face. Quit worrying about what everybody thinks. When you come to the end of life, you\u2019re not going to stand before people and give an account of your life, you\u2019re going to stand before God.

But when you go to God, you\u2019ll never be disappointed. God doesn\u2019t have to wait for the angel, for the treatment, for the boss to like you, for the loan to go through, for the economy to improve. He controls the universe. He\u2019s not limited by seasons. Just because you don\u2019t feel favored doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not favored. God being for you is more than the world being against you.

Listen to Joel's message, \"Blessed Out of Season\" on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Rg2ZkFgdZC You may have a situation where all the odds are against you, and every voice says to just accept it. God is saying, \u201cIs there any limit to My power?\u201d When you believe, all things are possible. God has you in the palm of His hand. He sees what\u2019s happening; He hasn\u2019t brought you this far to leave you. He\u2019s about to do something unusual, something bigger than you\u2019ve imagined.

He has it all figured out. His way is better than our way. You don\u2019t know what God is up to. You may feel overlooked, and nobody is giving you credit. Don\u2019t worry. God knows how to promote you out of season. When you\u2019re not just enduring a slow season, but you\u2019re releasing your faith and expecting God\u2019s goodness, He\u2019ll make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen.

He\u2019s going to make rivers in the desert. He\u2019s going to bless you out of season. You don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s praise. Know who you are. You have the applause of the One who controls the universe. It's better to have His applause than people\u2019s applause. The more difficult things are, the more we need to activate joy; the more pressure we feel, the more we need to look for opportunities to laugh. God knows every person that\u2019s done you wrong, every injustice, every bad break. He\u2019s going to pay you back. You\u2019re going to come out fully compensated, blessed, vindicated, honored.

Don't miss this message from Joel, \"The God Who Overrules\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/HZMVzn77dN The Scripture says, \u201cGreater is He that\u2019s in you, than he that comes against you.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid of the enemy, he\u2019s afraid of you. The enemy has already been defeated. We know the outcome. God said He always causes you to triumph. He said He\u2019s going to rule in your favor. If God can overrule death, the grave and the forces of darkness, He can overrule anything that comes against you. Listen to Joel this morning on podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA \"The God Who Overrules\" https://t.co/n8KmfRsbp2 Shake off the guilt, quit living condemned and receive the forgiveness, receive the mercy. Because of the blood of Jesus, our sins have been permanently taken away. Jesus went in and not only defeated the enemy, but He took away the keys of death and hell. The Scripture says He rendered him powerless. People can\u2019t undo every wrong. They can\u2019t give you back the years that they hurt you and put you at a disadvantage. The good news is, God can. When Jesus hung on the cross, He took all your mistakes, all your failures, all your weaknesses, and He forgave them. If you want to see real joy, be kind to people when there\u2019s no reason.

You don\u2019t have to live guilty and condemned. Because of the blood, we have an everlasting release from our sins. Receive that forgiveness. Too often we\u2019re looking at what people can\u2019t do when we should be looking at what God can do. Be encouraged with this message from Joel, \u201cThe Smile of God\". Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/WBwMp3wg6x When you honor God, God will always honor you. You can\u2019t give God something without Him giving you more back in return. Proverbs 17:22 says, \u201cLaughter is like taking a good medicine.\u201d Every day you need to take your medicine. Find something that makes you laugh. See the humor in life. When you\u2019re being the smile of God, God will smile back on you.

You\u2019re not doing it just for them; you\u2019re doing it unto God. God knows how to make it up to you. It\u2019s easy to be good to people that are being good to us. The test is when they\u2019ve betrayed you and now they need your help. Listen to Joel's message, \"The Smile of God\" on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/T4W4WxwnZx When you sow a seed of kindness, a seed of forgiveness, a seed of helping someone that hurt you, you\u2019re proving to God that He can trust you. Many things God asks us to do are not fair. It\u2019s not about being fair; it\u2019s about passing the test. If you\u2019ll do the right thing when it\u2019s hard, God will make it up to you. Be good to those that have betrayed you, show mercy to those that have hurt you. Be kind to the people that tried to hold you back. Click here to listen to \"The Smile of God\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/6cGGO8pwLH Paying people back is overrated. Being vindictive, getting even doesn\u2019t bring you lasting joy. That\u2019s a temporary high then it\u2019s gone. If you want to see real joy, real fulfillment, be kind to people when there\u2019s no reason, show mercy when you have the advantage, lift someone up when they pushed you down. Be the smile of God. When you\u2019re good to people that don\u2019t deserve it, you\u2019re being the smile of God. Check out Joel this morning on podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/gqLle07fzM One test we all have to pass is not just forgiving people but being good to those that have not been good to us. You may have been labeled at risk, but God labels you at possibility. You\u2019re the exception. You\u2019re supposed to go further. God didn\u2019t make you ordinary. God gives to every person different talents, different skills. We\u2019re not supposed to be the same. Quit comparing your talent to somebody else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to keep up with them, just run your race. It may take longer than you thought but that\u2019s okay, God\u2019s timing is the right time. It may not happen the way you had planned, but God\u2019s ways are not our ways. He knows what\u2019s best. God is working in ways that you can\u2019t see. What you think is opposition is really the hand of God putting you in position for promotion.

Nothing will be sadder than to come to the end of life and realize what you could have become. The enemy wouldn\u2019t be fighting you if you weren\u2019t a threat.

When the odds are against you\u2014the obstacle looks bigger, stronger, more powerful\u2014don\u2019t worry. God is about to make things happen that you could never make happen. God\u2019s not limited by your background, how you were raised or your education. He\u2019s all-powerful. He can take nothing and make something magnificent. People may have labeled you at risk, less than or average, but God labels you well able, equipped, anointed, talented, creative, a masterpiece. You may not see anything happening, but God\u2019s working behind the scenes. God controls the universe. Odds don\u2019t determine what He can and cannot do.

God has you in the palm of His hand. He\u2019s not going to fail you. He\u2019s faithful to His promises.

Paul said in Romans 12:6, \u201cGod has given each of us the ability to do certain things well.\u201d There\u2019s something you\u2019re good at. You have a gift. Find out what it is and do it well. God said He would pour out blessings that you don\u2019t have room enough to contain. If you have room, then you haven\u2019t seen the fullness of what God has in store.

When you get to heaven, you\u2019re not going to answer to people about what you did with your life, how you spent your time, and how you used your gifts. You\u2019re going to answer to God. Your destiny is too important to let people control you. The Scripture says, \u201cBe still and know that I am God.\u201d If you\u2019re not still, you won\u2019t see that He is God.

We can choose to not let things upset us, not go through life worried, frustrated, discouraged. You can\u2019t make people do what\u2019s right. You can pray for them; you can encourage them, but they have their own free will. Don\u2019t let them steal your joy.

Nothing that\u2019s happened to you has stopped God\u2019s plan. It may be taking a long time, but God knows how to get you to your destiny. Too often we have gifts lying dormant because we\u2019re not taking time to develop them. We\u2019re not being disciplined to study, to grow, to get better. Good enough is not your destiny.

You will reach levels that you couldn\u2019t reach without it. You need to be exposed to new levels so you can go to new levels. Don\u2019t be intimidated by someone that\u2019s further along; be inspired. You need good mentors. @AngieAsbery Thank you, we appreciate you! -JOM Team @GHYRLover Our team will be praying for you. You can also post your prayer request here and pray with others: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK. -JOM Team Surround yourself with people that will put their faith with yours. Listen to Joel's new message, \"The Power of the Soil\" on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/RjeL67Vzwp Make plans for our next Night of Hope, Friday April 20 at @TUCenter in Albany, NY! Click here for details: https://t.co/KLLqrUxNjS https://t.co/9n587nyqKW Not every friend will inspire you, but you should have one or two that light a fire on the inside\u2014that push you forward. If you only invest in people that are at the same level as you, you\u2019ll get stuck. If you will put yourself in an environment with friends that challenge and inspire you, with people that push you up, then those seeds will take root, and you will begin to blossom. Your seed can\u2019t flourish in bad soil. God has given you what you need to live a victorious life. Click here to listen to, \"The Power of the Soil\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/X6JR3PJZmh Are you holding on to something God\u2019s asking you to let go of\u2014someone or something that\u2019s pulling you down, keeping you from your best? Your seed can\u2019t flourish in that soil. That\u2019s limiting your growth. Get around dreamers, connect with people that are more talented, more successful, more experienced and glean from them. That\u2019s good soil. Eighty percent will tell you what you can't do. You have to find the twenty percent that will tell you what you can do. Watch this new message from Joel this morning on podcast! \"The Power of the Soil\" https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/dYwt3LzzBr You can have a good seed that\u2019s healthy, strong and full of potential, but if it\u2019s not planted in good soil, it\u2019s not going to become what it was created to be. By ourselves we\u2019ll survive the difficulty, but together we\u2019ll come out better. There\u2019s power in unity. Your time is too valuable, your destiny is too great, your assignment too important to get baited into battles that don\u2019t matter. When people try to push you down, God will lift you up. When they try to make you look bad, He\u2019ll cause you to shine. What God has spoken over you has an appointed time to come to pass. Don\u2019t get discouraged. The silence is temporary. Check out Joel's podcast, \"Seasons of Silence\" today! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/yUjmZD5bjx You can talk yourself into defeat, or you can talk yourself into victory. When you speak to yourself the right way, strength, courage, vision and healing come. People can dislike you without a cause. These are tests you have to pass. Stay on the high road. They don\u2019t control your destiny. @yongshi22 Thank you, we appreciate you! -JOM Team @NelsonOne God is our healer and our restorer. Let us pray with you here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK -JOM Team Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people, it comes from the Lord. Be encouraged with this new message from Joel, \u201c Seasons of Silence.\" Download it today: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/dAT5KJPrfV When you face difficulties, more than ever, you need to keep your mind filled with thoughts of faith, surround yourself with people that will speak life and hope, people that will agree with what you\u2019re believing for. You\u2019ll never give God something that He won\u2019t give you more back in return. God sees the sacrifice. He sees what it took to get here. Every time you obey, there\u2019s a blessing that follows. Billy Graham has always been and will always be a hero in our home.  Next to my own father, Reverend Graham was the most humble and gracious man I ever knew. I am honored to call him a friend and a mentor. Victoria and I will miss him dearly. https://t.co/8kkj3kYRJo When thoughts tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s never going to change, it\u2019s been too long,\" know that God is still on the throne. Your time is coming. You've been armed with strength for this battle. Just as God hid you, He will bring you out into the open. He\u2019ll shine His light on you and cause you to go where you could not go on your own. Make plans for our next Night of Hope, Friday April 20 at @TUCenter in Albany NY! Click here for details: https://t.co/KLLqrUxNjS https://t.co/nnLkah2tVp In the silent seasons, when you\u2019re hidden, learn to trust God in new ways.  Listen to Joel's new message, \" Seasons of Silence\" on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/vC7hAmH8AW It\u2019s a season of silence, not a lifetime of silence. What God has spoken over you has an appointed time to come to pass. Don\u2019t get discouraged, the silence is temporary. God doesn\u2019t waste anything. It\u2019s all a part of the process. The difficulties, the delays, the unfair situations, if we keep the right attitude, it\u2019s working for our good. When it\u2019s your time, no person, no bad break, no injustice can stop you. Check out this new message, \"Seasons of Silence\" from Joel this morning on podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/3vBot0Geft Do the right thing when it\u2019s hard, keep a good attitude when people are not treating you right, go the extra mile when nobody is watching. It\u2019s much better to let God promote you, not people. Don\u2019t get in a hurry. If you\u2019ll let God do it His way, it will be better than anything you could have made happen. God will be involved in your life as much as you want Him to be. If you keep him in a Sunday morning box, He\u2019ll stay there. But He wants to be so much more than that. God wants you to set a new level. He wants to take you where you\u2019ve never dreamed. Keep yourself in an environment of faith, hope, and victory. You won\u2019t run and not be weary if you\u2019re focused on your problems. What causes your strength to be renewed is when you live with expectancy and know that God is working in your life. It\u2019s easy to work all the time, but that\u2019s doing yourself and the people around you a disservice. Even when God created the universe, on the seventh day, He rested. You don\u2019t have to be the most qualified, the most experienced. God can still take you higher. Listen to \"The God Who Crosses His Arms\" today on podcast! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/S5EpBHQIAu You don\u2019t lack any good thing.  Don\u2019t give fear a name, don\u2019t let it rule your life. Be strong and of good courage. Move forward and occupy the territory God has reserved for you. We\u2019re not going to understand everything but God has a purpose. He knows how to bring good out of it. Keep moving forward. In the dark times, when life feels unfair, you have to remind yourself that God is still in control. Refuse to worry.  Instead, thank Him that He\u2019s fighting your battles. God loves to choose people that others think are not qualified. Don't miss \"The God Who Crosses His Arms\". Get this and all of Joel's messages on podcast!\u00a0https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/vSiyl2t3AU You don\u2019t have to defend yourself. God said that He will defend you. He will protect your reputation. The arm of the Lord is not too short to deliver you, to provide for you, to vindicate you, to promote you. You\u2019re about to see God take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own. People may rule you out, they may tell you it\u2019s not going to happen, but God has the final say.

You are closer than you think. When God decides to bless you He\u2019ll show you mercy that you didn\u2019t deserve, favor that you didn\u2019t earn. It wasn\u2019t anything you did, it's simply the favor of God. @nicholasbenja13 Our team will be praying for you. You can also post your prayer request here and pray with others: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK. -JOM Team @Yvonne16586961 God is our healer and our restorer.

Click here to listen to, \"The God Who Crosses His Arms\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/L0S01XD5uP Don\u2019t waste your valuable time with people that can\u2019t celebrate the blessing God put on your life. Don\u2019t apologize for it. You didn\u2019t choose it, God chose you. People may rule you out, they may tell you it\u2019s not going to happen, but God has the final say. When He decides to bless you, He\u2019s going to make something happen that you didn\u2019t see coming. You\u2019re about to see God take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own. Check out this new message from Joel this morning on podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/iZVe79DuUf It\u2019s not luck, it\u2019s favor. It\u2019s God shining down on you making things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. You may be off course and made some poor decisions, but He\u2019s already recalculated your route. God already has a new way to get you to your destination. Don't complain about the opposition, that person that\u2019s trying to hold you down, trying to make you look bad. They don\u2019t control your destiny, God does. Even though it may look bad, feel bad and be unfair, when it all comes together, God\u2019s going to use it for your good. @InmonPamela Thank you for allowing us to speak life-giving words to you. -JOM Team No mistake you\u2019ve made cancelled out your destiny. God knows how to reroute you. Watch \"Miracles out of Mistakes\" on podcast! https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/Cvkirgdii5 Don\u2019t ignore what you\u2019re hearing on the inside. God can see things we can\u2019t see. He knows how to accelerate your dreams and make things happen quicker than you think. Sometimes you need to thank God for what didn\u2019t happen. Thank Him for the enemies He\u2019s stopped that you knew nothing about. Quit beating yourself up. Quit reliving all your failures. It\u2019s not too late. God\u2019s mercy is bigger than any mistake. Get the entire message \u201cMiracles out of Mistakes\u201d here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/G0DMIX1ARt Don\u2019t take for granted what God has done. Keep it on the forefront of your mind. You\u2019re not just lucky. His hand is on your life. God\u2019s not trying to take something from you; He\u2019s trying to get something better to you. If you\u2019ll trust Him and do what you know you need to do, you\u2019ll come into a new level of your destiny. @4FaithLiving We are so sorry for your loss. May the Lord fill you with hope, peace and joy. -JOM Team You haven\u2019t made too many mistakes; you haven\u2019t blown it too many times. God\u2019s calling on your life is irrevocable. Get this inspiring message from Joel now on podcast!\u00a0https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/HYJZLbu7UN We\u2019re not going to understand everything that happens. If you try to figure it all out then you\u2019ll get frustrated. Trust in God. Sometimes your enemies will do more to promote you than your friends. They thought they were going to stop you, discourage you, intimidate you, but they didn\u2019t realize God used them to light a fire on the inside. When we make mistakes God doesn\u2019t abandon us. He\u2019s full of mercy.

You may turn your back on Him, but He won\u2019t turn His back on you. Quit living condemned, beating yourself up, thinking you\u2019ve seen your best days. God has something greater in your future. God didn\u2019t base His plan for your life on you making perfect decisions. \"Miracles out of Mistakes\" is out now on podcast! https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/CuAXjIsBKc God has mercy for every mistake. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, He won\u2019t just bring you through it, He\u2019ll bring you out better. Don\u2019t get discouraged by what you see with your physical eyes. Through your eyes of faith, you need to see every obstacle that\u2019s holding you back surrounded by the Most High. You\u2019ve been faithful, you\u2019ve honored God. Now He\u2019s about to show out in your life. Start each day, \u201cFather, thank You that You\u2019re going to exceed my expectations.\u201d When you develop trust, you let God do it His way. If the door opens, you thank Him; if it doesn\u2019t open, you still thank Him. You may not see a way, but God has a way. Put your faith out there.  Click here to listen to the entire message, \"The God Who Exceeds Expectations.\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EchMkXLPTq Faith gets God\u2019s attention, but obedience activates His power. You can have great faith, but if you\u2019re ignoring what God is asking you to deal with, then it will keep you from your miracle. Sometimes your enemies will do more to promote you than your friends. They thought they were going to stop you, discourage you, intimidate you, but they didn\u2019t realize God used them to light a fire on the inside. @Emilyashley08 God is our healer and our restorer.

It\u2019s all good. God allowed it; He\u2019s going to use it. God knew there would be times when we wouldn\u2019t have the faith we need. But He said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll just have a little bit of faith, then I\u2019ll do My part; I\u2019ll exceed your expectations.\u201d @dnewbern01 Thank you, we appreciate you! -JOM Team @MattMumaw God is our healer and our restorer.

He\u2019s not going to do what you\u2019re asking for; He\u2019s going to exceed it. God is a supernatural God. He specializes in exceeding our expectations. What He has planned for you is bigger, more rewarding, more fulfilling than you\u2019ve dreamed. We think ordinary; God thinks extraordinary. We ask for the possible when God wants to do the impossible. Check out this new message from Joel this morning on podcast! https://t.co/C3pPncKCKA https://t.co/sdxAdwaxqx This is a new day; God is doing a new thing. He\u2019s about to exceed your expectations. He\u2019s about to do things that you\u2019ve never imagined. You can\u2019t put God in a box. He may not bring your dream to pass in the way you thought. He may not turn that problem around in a traditional way. Stay open and let God do it His way. You may not feel blessed, successful, strong, healthy or creative, but God calls you what you are before you become it. What God has set up will find you. You won\u2019t have to go after it, it will come after you. Don\u2019t seek the blessing; seek God. Keep Him first place, and the blessing will seek you. You can rise higher with Joel\u2019s message, \"It's Already Set Up\" on podcast! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Bvz4gUm3cl It\u2019s easy to go through life wearing different masks, but God won't bless who you pretend to be. He blesses people who are real. God is not only strategically directing your steps, but He\u2019s orchestrating everything around you. @sofeigroupinc God is our healer and our restorer.

They can\u2019t see your seeds of greatness. They don\u2019t know what God has already set up for you. God knows what you need, when you need it, and how to get it to you. Watch this new message from Joel now, \"It's Already Set Up\" https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/y0w6OiLDyW God wouldn\u2019t have given you the dream, He wouldn\u2019t have put the promise in your heart if He had not already set up how to bring it to pass. When you live open and honest, God will make you and mold you into a vessel of honor used for His highest purposes. How many things are you missing out on, not because God doesn\u2019t want to do it, but because you\u2019re not asking? You may think you\u2019re surrounded by the enemy, but the truth is the enemy is surrounded by our God.
