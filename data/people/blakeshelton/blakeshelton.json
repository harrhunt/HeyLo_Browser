Thank you god!!!! https://t.co/rWmVEpmXM2 What a truly devastating loss. I loved Mel. I will miss him terribly. My thoughts and prayers to all his family. He did his best to try and keep my head on straight. I looked up to Mel more than he could've possibly known. A talented songwriter. An incredible entertainer. And a funny funny guy. It has been a couple years since I saw him last. I deeply regret that now. He once spent an entire day at his place in Tennessee showing me all the memorabilia he'd gathered over the years where he gave me a pair of his stage boots. He even took time to talk me through some hard times in my life on a couple phone calls. Some of my most cherished memories are the times I spent with Mel Tillis. Many many great memories. From fishing, to just having a beer, to him crashing my concert! Good luck to my friend @Elliott_Sadler today!!!! Go get that championship buddy!!!
