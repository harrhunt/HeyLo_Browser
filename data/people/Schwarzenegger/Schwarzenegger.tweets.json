Never. I left that day with a stomach so full I was about to pop. But I also left with a full heart, because I saw the best of America. And let me tell you: firefighters can cook. I ate one meal after another because I didn\u2019t want to be rude, and when you have a chance to eat with your heroes, you never say no. At Ground Zero, I saw them working through tears and hugged more heroes than I could count. At the three firehouses I visited, they just wanted me to work out and eat with them. They were exhausted and they were in mourning, but they just kept going because they were serving a cause bigger than themselves. I will always remember visiting the first responders in New York less than a month later. I was there to help pump them up after their tragic, non-stop work. But they were the ones who inspired me. Today we remember. We remember the victims, their families, and the heroes. We remember the way the country came together and stood as one.

The solution is taking the power to draw their lines away from the politicians and giving it to independent commissions, as states around the country are doing. I will continue to fight for reform across the country, in Republican and Democratic states. To my fellow Republicans who say this doesn't matter, remember that the tables can turn. For years, Democrats were the leaders in gerrymandering efforts, and President Reagan called gerrymandering \"anti-Democratic and un-American.\" One person/one vote is a vital part of our government, but gerrymandering allows politicians to pick their voters and scam the system and the people don't get the representation they deserve. In West Virginia, Democrats received 41% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats. In Arkansas, Democrats received 36% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats. In Pennsylvania, Democrats won 54.1% of the State House election vote, but 45.8% of the seats. In Virginia, Democrats received 54% of the State House election vote, but 48% of the seats. In Illinois, Democrats won 61% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 72% of the seats. Also in Wisconsin, Democrats won 54% of the votes for State Assembly, but 36% of the seats. In Wisconsin, Republicans won 46% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 63% of the seats. In Ohio, Republicans won 52% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 75% of the seats. In Texas, Republicans won 50% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 64% of the seats. In North Carolina, Republicans won 51% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 77% of the seats. In Maryland, Republicans won 32.5% of the votes for U.S. House, but only 12.5% of the seats. Gerrymandering deprives Americans of all parties of their representation. Instead, we get mis-representation.

His movies created many thousands of jobs in Hollywood over decades. Last night was one of the best @TheAcademy Awards shows I\u2019ve seen. Fantastic performances, smooth flow, and almost a perfect show. The only failure was leaving film icons like Andy Vajna, Carol Channing, R.

They willingly gave some of their power back to the people. I hope other legislators around the country take note. This is a great victory for Virginians and all Americans.

Remember that throughout our history, people from different backgrounds, races, and political parties have come together to defend America. Emulate them. Remember we are all on the same side. Never forget. It is easy to be offended. It is easy to lash out. It is easy to think of Americans with different views as the other side. But that is the path of weakness. @DanCrenshawTX showed us how to be strong, how to do the hard work of coming together, how to rise above. As we observe Veterans Day today, I can't stop thinking about the grace and courage @DanCrenshawTX showed on @nbcsnl this weekend. He taught all of us an urgent lesson that can help us through our current divisions. https://t.co/ch1TPpfmfZ I always tell people I am not a self-made man.

The constitution starts with \u201cWe the people,\u201d not \u201cWe the politicians\u201d and I will stand on the side of the people and support every effort to #TerminateGerrymandering. I want to thank every person I met who worked on these campaigns, all of the volunteers, and those of you who donated your hard-earned money to help achieve victory. You inspire me. Earlier this year Ohioans passed their own reform. We have the momentum. The rigged scam of gerrymandering is 200 years old, but these states join California and Arizona in telling the politicians that you don\u2019t get to pick your voters any more - we pick you. Whether you rooted for a blue wave or a red wave, the biggest wave last night was the people\u2019s wave. And it swept through our country. Three states - MI, CO, and MO - reformed their redistricting process and we are waiting on results from UT. #TerminateGerrymandering Thank you. Hopefully soon, it will be hasta la vista to gerrymandering everywhere. https://t.co/zKz6paja2u Congratulations Colorado and each and every one of you who campaigned to #TerminateGerrymandering!
