Only question now: will @mlkhattar still be CM in new arrangement? #ResultOnAajTak Bloody good day to be an independent in Haryana.. what\u2019s the going rate one wonders!! #ResultOnAajTak Whoever forms Govt in Haryana and Maharashtra, the winning team has to be \u2066@IndiaToday\u2069 and \u2066@aajtak\u2069 and \u2066@PradeepGuptaAMI\u2069 in particular.

Pl send us your questions on the #ResultOnAajTak Pollsters get elections wrong. It\u2019s not a perfect science or maths. But those who predicted 75 and above to BJP in Haryana owe an explanation maybe to their viewers. #ResultsAajTak BJP still most likely to form a Govt in both Haryana and Maharashtra.. but no sweep in both states.. Big winners so Far: Dushyant Chautala in Haryana and Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra.. this is as of 11.04 am. Could change dramatically in Haryana. Lots of thin margins: 20 seats with less than 1000 votes.. #ResultOnAajTak Economic discontent and local issues matter more than Article 370 in a state election.. can\u2019t go to a Parli where there is no water and speak of Article 370 as a winning formula Assembly polls a different ball game to Lok Sabha.. BJP down by a third and more in both Haryana and Maharashtra compared to LS Lots of big takeaways from Assembly polls: a) @PradeepGuptaAMI in another league as a pollster .

I did a front page story from Umerkhadi in Mumbai: Muslim League vs Shiv Sena! There was blatant stuffing of ballot papers. We exposed it and a repoll was ordered. Today when people complain of EVMs, am reminded of what the world was in pre EVM age. The Shiv Sena asked for 200 seats, BJP was barely able to put up 88 candidates! Sena supremo, Balasaheb Thackeray dictated terms a bit like @AmitShah does for BJP today. Rajiv Gandhi was Cong Prez and the party still was numero uno in Maharashtra. NCP didn\u2019t even exist!

If @SGanguly99 wants to join the BJP, he is welcome but there is no deal with him for becoming BCCI president @AmitShah tells @IndiaToday .. The case against me was a fake one says @AmitShah ; the one against @PChidambaram_IN is of corruption that has taken 5 years for investigation, there is no link.. he tells @rahulkanwal on @IndiaToday tv . On now! So the economist who was deeply involved in Rahul Gandhi minimum income scheme gets the Nobel for economics: proof that politics and economics don\u2019t always go together! Abhijit Banerjee has done stellar work on \u2018poverty economics\u2019. Well deserved recognition!

A great channel is built by fine reporters.. anchors are like buses, there is always another one around the corner!! My dear friend and team-mate, only majorbregret: didn\u2019t have the talent to play cricket at the highest level .. or maybe even give cricket gyaan on @StarSportsIndia aka @bhogleharsha ! https://t.co/xs5yGBX66X @UrmilaMatondkar @PrannoyRoyNDTV @Raghav_Bahl @aroonpurie Thanks!\ud83d\ude4f RT @amritat: And finally, dear friends in the media, if you are covering #WorldMentalHealthDay pl share that *help is available* you can li\u2026 @manishndtv @PrannoyRoyNDTV @Raghav_Bahl @aroonpurie That is your kindness to say that my friend Embarking on another Maharashtra election where it all began in 1988-89, I feel nostalgic.Any advise to young journalists? Just what the great RK Laxman told me at @timesofindia \u2018young man, in journalism each day is a new one. Enjoy, you are only as good as your last story!\u2019 Am told digital is the future as is citizen journalism, a concept we launched in India at CNN IBN. I now do a digital weekly Hindi show called Neta Nagri for the @TheLallantop website which has really caught on. 25 years in Delhi seem to have improved my Hindi at least! What lies ahead? I don\u2019t know. A lot of tv news leaves me angry and depressed. I still write columns and next month, my 2019 elections book comes out: I have worked on it for a year now and I hope all of you will like it as many of you did the 2014 election book. Books are spl! In 2014, I moved to India Today as a consulting editor. I was fortunate to be part of a group with stature and ambition who gave me space to do my own thing.Being part of a \u2018democratic\u2019 newsroom with India\u2019s number one Hindi news channel @aajtak has been another great learning. In 2005, I moved to Network 18 to set up CNN IBN, later IBN 7 and IBN Lokmat. Initially, no one gave us a hope: a new English news channel a leading adman told me was not needed! But we had a great team and did some terrific journalism: 200 awards in 9 incredible years! When I moved to tv from print in 1994 I didn\u2019t really think I\u2019d last as long as I have. The early years are a blur. NDTV was a pioneer: it was a time of fun, learning and excitement. When we first started a 24 x 7 channel, I recall telling the Roys, who will watch so much news! This week marks 25 years in tv journalism (31 years in the profession next month) from a weekly World This Week to daily half hour shows to 24 x 7 news have been part of an incredible roller coaster. Grateful to many colleagues, mentors. @PrannoyRoyNDTV @Raghav_Bahl @aroonpurie Suprabhatam! Doing what you like is freedom. Liking what you do is happiness. Have a super day friends!! My take: forget desi or foreign origins of a word, lynching in name of religion is a horrific crime. Period. https://t.co/2AR4Qy4ILw RT @IndiaToday: Is the word 'lynching' being used to defame India?\nWatch #NewsToday with @sardesairajdeep: https://t.co/RjwWQu364T https://\u2026 @KingKhanna Which is why there is still hope that sanity will prevail in the end..

Richly deserved @Ram_Guha ! https://t.co/QGJ7lFXi8f What\u2019s in a name Mohanrao? Surely, the first step should be to strongly condemn/ostracise all those who misuse religion to perpetuate violence, be it terror or lynching. Violence is sadly part of every culture.. https://t.co/wzNwNOCWqX @digvijaya_28 Sir, my practise is limited to my own journalism.. whenever I stray away from the path, feel free to condemn! Line of the day from WB CM @MamataOfficial \u2018religion belongs to an individual but a festival belongs to everybody\u2019! Well said Didi!! @TVMohandasPai Nope.. when \u2018unknown\u2019 people kill/commit acts of violence in name of religion, they must be called out. Then whichever religion they belong to.

An unknown Maulana makes a stupid remark on Trinamool MP  #NusratJahan dancing at Pujo, and this becomes the \u2018big debate\u2019 of the day!

Very few have done so.. will they now bite the bullet? The other thing I liked is that there was no \u2018triumphalist\u2019 note in the PM speech. Maybe some of his cheerleaders need to adopt a similar note of cautious optimism rather than outright jubilation. Trust deficit remains very large..

Which is why a complex issue like J and K needs to be handled with sensitivity and not the sledge hammer. No quick fix solutions. Buzz that PM could address the nation on J and K this evening which is good news. But here\u2019s the nub:what of the near total information and communication black-out in the Kashmir valley. PM Modi needs to surely speak to Kashmiris in the valley, not just to the rest of us. Agree? @ejazhaider No, sadly there wasn\u2019t. Which is why it is all the more important for BOTH sides to keep pushing the diplomatic envelope for ways in which peace and sanity can be restored. Withdrawing/expelling diplomats won\u2019t achieve that. @gulu1959 Lovely pic Gulu.. thanks Here\u2019s wishing a very happy birthday to @rogerfederer Kane Williamson and late Dilip Sardesai.: not a bad day to be born a sportsperson! Have a super day friends!! The Pakistan move to expel Indian high com, the very able diplomat Ajay Bisaria, is short sighted and foolish. How does Pakistan intend to seek dialogue with India when you won\u2019t even allow a proper diplomatic presence in your country? Hopefully, better sense will prevail. @FGMallick Well, Pakistan can\u2019t send terrorists across the border and then take the moral high ground. No solution at gunpoint. Breaking now: Pakistan downgrades diplomatic ties, expels Indian envoy, recalls its high commissioner says AFP.. unfortunate.

Sushma Swaraj, politician of substance, a woman who was a trend setter, the BJP\u2019s mascot, a remarkable debater in Parliament., fiesty but gracious. in space of two weeks, first Sheilaji, now Sushmaji, 2 Delhi CMs, both role models for women in public life.. RIP And while every Delhi-based news channel obsesses about J and K, a friend from Goa calls up: can you please also tell the rest of the country that Goa-Karnataka is facing flood fury? Further you move southwards from Delhi, more you realise that there is world beyond the valley! May I suggest sir that you read the meaning of 'unwitting' in the dictionary; if you are telling me that the 'intention' of the break up of J and K into two UTs is to give Ladakh greater autonomy (which incidentally it deserves), then I must suspend disbelief. https://t.co/crjy8stNMo RT @nandilbhatia: @sardesairajdeep Very interesting to hear views from all stakeholders in the show today. Best part is to reserve one\u2019s pe\u2026 Former AG Soli Sorabje tells me that the revocation of Article 370, reorganising J and K is constitutionally valid but preventive detention of Kashmiri leaders is illegal, must be revoked. @IndiaToday News Today: 9 pm: Jammu and Kashmir/Ladakh are now union territories, Article 370 is effectively out. historic day or historic blunder? My guests include @ShashiTharoor @DrJitendraSingh @MPLadakh among others.. @IndiaToday news without noise.. Democratic decentralisation for one part of J and K is being seen as \u2018dis-memberment\u2019 by another part. And lost in it all is Kargil! https://t.co/QMG8q1TfUy Do you expect me to seriously believe that the 'dismemberment' of J and K was for Ladakhi aspirations? REALLY? https://t.co/trcudGnZnj Star of the Lok Sabha debate today on Article 370: the young BJP MP from Ladakh, Tsering Namgyal. Maybe Ladakh will be the unwitting beneficiary of the government\u2019s Mission Kashmir https://t.co/7cWc2aWzpV Interesting: right through the Article  370 debate in Lok Sabha when the issue of Sardar Patel\u2019s concurrence to special status is raised (as @ShashiTharoor did), the treasury benches rise to protest. Like Ambedkar, Sardar is now beyond even the slightest questioning.. @imprabhath Thanks!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f BJP minister @DrJitendraSingh : \u2018article 370 was the greatest historic blunder for which Nehru is responsible  .. \u0906\u091c \u0939\u092e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u2019; every BJP MP is honoured to be part of history today..\u2019 (guess there can be no debate in parliament on Kashmir without ref to Nehru!) Surprisingly strong speech by TR Baalu of the DMK in Lok Sabha. Asks a pointed question: do you really expect the Kashmir issue to be resolved by reducing J and K to a municipality level UT to be headed by some joint secretary who you will make the LG? @yashoazad Ladakh makes sense and deserves its  autonomy . But what of Kargil which may not want to be part of the UT? But most crucially, why rest of J and K as a UT? A state being made a UT can\u2019t be done with such brazen disregard for constitutional morality @yashoazad Yes.. but at the cost of \u2018dis-membering\u2019 a state and reducing it to a UT? How India\u2019s map has changed over the years.. worth a watch.. https://t.co/KxCpl75wzs Neither Palestine nor Shangri-la: this is not a time for fear mongering or celebration but reflection. My take: https://t.co/GCqNBCfRK7 Once upon a time in Kashmir.. pure nostalgia.. gnight shubhratri.. https://t.co/o7zVHv3P1J Till now, no one in Govt has been able to explain with any justification why  a state of J and K is reduced to a union territory. Which manifesto calls for the \u2018dis-membering\u2019 of a state like this? Article 370 may have its own debatable consequences but why touch statehood? Here is a good graphic why in theory Article 370 is discriminatory and should ideally go.. now, if only it had been done in a less heavy handed, more consensual, less opaque and not in a constitutionally immoral manner.. in a fragile situation, means matter as much as ends too! https://t.co/oVwTFCBusr A question posed by Vivek Tankha, perhaps the only Kashmiri Pandit MP in the Rajya Sabha. Asks a simple question: can any Kashmiri Pandit return home now that Article 370 is scrapped overnight without consulting any of the affected groups and keeping a state under curfew? To Pakistan: what moral right do you have to speak for Kashmir when you unleash terror groups on its soil? finally to the people of India: is Kashmir simply a piece of land or is it about its people, their concerns and beliefs. Have we got trapped in a Hindu Muslim binary? Congress has been in power for much of the last 72 years. what concrete steps were taken to get Kashmir back on track? To Valley parties: did you fail the people of the state by building family dynasties? To jihadi groups: how is the gun a solution to a political issue? Very interesting debate in RS on Article 370. But few qs: why are mobiles/TV screens blanked out in valley? Shouldn\u2019t the Kashmiris as stakeholders be listening to a debate on their future? Govt speaker attacking Muftis/Abdullahs. Hey, weren\u2019t these guys your allies till yday? In pure political terms, @AmitShah and the BJP seem to have scored a triumph with move to scrap Article 370; many oppn parties also supporting it in parliament. PDP MPs who protested removed from the Rajya Sabha. narrative of \u2018muscular\u2019 nationalism is well and truly back again. Article 370 now stands scrapped through a presidential notification. . BJP claims to have fulfilled a long standing promise in its manifesto stretching back to SP Mookerjee.. \u2018special status\u2019 for J and K is over. Expect a challenge in SC as the final act. @IndiaToday tv Presidential order issued on reorganising J and K that scraps Article 370, effectively bypassing parliamentary requirement for a two thirds majority through a constitution amendment. @IndiaToday tv Breaking now: Ladakh will be a union territory without a state legislature. J and K will be a union territory with a legislature. With the reorganisation of J and K, article 370 and article 35 A both stand effectively redundant.. @IndiaToday tv Big breaking news: Jammu and Kashmir split into 2 union territories: J and K and Ladakh. Article 370 stands modified. More to follow! And while a nation awaits a \u2018decision\u2019 on Kashmir, the sensex down by more than 400 points in early trade.. when army goes north, economy goes south! @RiteshAc Quite right sir. Like demonetisation with black money which now happily floats in pink 2000 rupee notes! Extraordinary steps must be backed by loads common sense too! \ud83d\udc4d Societies move ahead by instilling hope and confidence in its citizens, not by spreading fear and uncertainty.

My take in TOI https://t.co/rRbpRTfoo2 If VG Siddhartha letter is genuine (yet to be verified), then it only confirms what bizmem have been saying for a while now: tax terrorism is taking us back to the past, retarding investment/growth. And if this can happen to the son in law of SM Krishna, god help  small bizmen. Breaking now: Triple Talaq bill set to be passed in Rajya Sabha and become law.

And both will be asked the questions they need to be asked without name calling. To answer is their prerogative, to choose which \u2018side\u2019 is yours! @Tajamul_I_Shah @SaketGokhale No sir. The story of the Kashmiri Muslims, (rather Indian citizens) who were released after 23 years was also one of my top stories. So quit the selective outrage charge please.. will highlight any genuine case of miscarriage of justice brought to my notice. Who will give this police officer the four years he lost? And his reputation? Will someone bloody well say sorry in public?

Have a good day friends!! @rohini_sgh Both arguments were heard in parliament today. The criminalisation one is valid and worth examining; the anti Islam one isn\u2019t convincing at all. @StonerJesus No.. which is why the bill needs to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent its misuse. But the fear of misuse cannot be reason not to have the legislation. When opposition MPs say triple Talaq bill in present form is anti Islam, the counter question must be: is it anti or pro women? Rather than couch the debate in religious terms, it should revolve around gender justice surely, no? Agree? Breaking now: Karnataka speaker adds another twist to the Nataka: disqualifies 3 MLAs, keeps others waiting! Most interesting: for the first time, a speaker rules the disqualified MLAs can\u2019t contest elections during duration of assembly till 2023!

She is plainly a bigoted soul who could do with a better education rather than being tangled in ugly politics. From Karnataka to Goa, as politicians switch sides with growing brazenness, the party system has completely broken down writes @sagarikaghose . All, we the citizens can do is vent on social media! https://t.co/hgDWmtg0qj Suprabhatam!

The most crazy crazy night in sport.. do you still have a heartbeat folks? Fine margins of sport.. @imVkohli given lbw to a 50-50 umpires call; Jason Roy gets away with the same umpires call when he looked pretty plumb.. #CWC19Final One of the best things about watching the World Cup finals: less breathless hysteria, less screaming by the channels.

Today, the same Babush is set to be sworn in as a BJP minister in Goa! How low has our politics sunk? Any \u2018party with a difference\u2019 left? Interesting: 8 of the 10 MLAs who defected in Goa from Cong to BJP are Catholics. Classic case of \u2018Secular\u2019 immorality where lust for power cuts across all religious barriers!! First it was Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil in Maharashtra, now Chandrakant Kavlekar in Goa.. both Cong leaders of opposition in their respective states, both overnight ministers in a BJP Govt. My view: once you switch sides, you should be denied a ministership for 5 years! Agree? Can watch this shot again and again. And ask myself: is Roger Federer for real? A Sachin straight drive, a Jordan clutch shot, a Bolt sprint, and yes, the Roger backhand. When sports is sublime.. https://t.co/ZWd9UbZuFN Suprabhatam!
