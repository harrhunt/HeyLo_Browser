Did you become more intimate with Jake since the beginning of Southpaw? Like, do you go to a cute dinner sometime\u2026 .@i_love_eminem96 The director Antoine Fuqua actually put 50 in the movie. I think he killed it. #Southpaw RT @i_love_eminem96: #DearSlim did you recommend 50 for his role in southpaw? .@HipHopDX Lose Yourself was more of a theme for the film #Southpaw .@HipHopDX Phenomenal is different from Lose Yourself.

It's fun for a small parts but my real passion is music. So we'll see\u2026 #Southpaw .@SalernoSimo Well I have done movies before... Only one I was a main character in but others where I did small parts.
