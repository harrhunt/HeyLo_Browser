The most encouraging thing for India is that the wickets have been shared between the quicks and the spinners. It means there is always a wicket-taking bowler that the captain to turn to There is a lot of talk around the world about pitches in India. It is time to bury that because the last few wins have all come on normal pitches. Here in Ranchi, Saha collected a ball over his head on the 4th morning! A great catch and a bizarre dismissal this morning. But it took only 9 mins and 2 overs to produce India's biggest win over South Africa India's win today will make it 26 wins out of 32 matches played at home. Of these 26 wins, the closest has been 6 wickets or 75 runs.

Once that is done de Bruyn will probably bat. Gets worse for South Africa. Elgar can't resume his innings so it is Klassen and Linde already. Maybe it is effectively 26-5 but more important, hope Elgar recovers soon. For someone who has admired South African cricket greatly, this is inexplicable. I know there are many issues but none that can explain this capitulation South Africa's best batting phase. The 9th wicket is the most productive partnership and the ball, after 45 overs, is softer There is no perceptible change in Jadeja's release between the one that turns and the other that goes straight through.

Each of those five pitched in. And then, Saha was magnificent. This is a quality Indian team. India's biggest win over South Africa. Been better at all aspects. And the series has been won, not on minefields, but on perfectly good tracks. This one in Pune was excellent. @hershybru Haha! You scored too many against India so was good to bring that up!

The key players had a good test and I don't see the need to make a change for Pune. South Africa have much to contemplate, especially with respect to the composition of their bowling. The resistance was resolute but the peak was too high to scale for South Africa. Second innings Shami was magnificent again.1-0 Muthisamy and Piedt have now scored more runs and played more balls in this partnership than all those that preceded them! This is a fine effort How good has Shami been today. Has hit the stumps three times. India has so many bowlers to turn to now. Won't be surprised if even Ishant has a role to play Just the start India wanted. The manner in which de Bruyn and Bavuma got out would make the dressing room uncomfortable. Interesting day in prospect. 5th day wicket but it doesn't look like a normal worn out Indian 5th day pitch. Only 22 wickets have fallen so far.

What an eye-catching player Abid Ali is. The name of course is special to me because our Abid chicha was a childhood hero. With all the attention on Rohit Sharma today, inevitable given his history in test cricket and giant stature in limited overs cricket, Mayank Agarwal quietly dished out a mature, controlled innings..his six over cover to get to 50, was very classy. South Africa have many questions to answer on the potency of their bowling in these conditions. They will need a much better day tomorrow All the talk before the game was about Rohit Sharma, the opener. All the talk now is about Rohit Sharma, the opener. A century on his first opportunity is a nice way to say \"I'm here\" Just about perfect session for India. Win toss bat first. Negotiate the brief period while the new ball is threatening. Go hard at the spinners. Build a solid platform. So often, the first session of a test has a bearing on the series. With his heart briefly in his mouth, Rohit Sharma produces a half century that will surely mean a lot to him. @Kale_Sid @ImRo45 Thanks @parikhdeep12 @BCCI @ImRo45 Thanks @strawbazzer Yes, but I just thought I would point it out.... @prasannakovalam No @VAMOSVK That is exactly the point I was making....

KL Rahul has to go back to domestic cricket and that may not be so bad for him. And I think the selectors have been prudent with Hardik Pandya given recent fitness issues. The arrival of Vihari &amp; the fact that the next five tests are in India probably made it tough anyway Either way it is hard on the two players who have scored runs everytime they have been given an opportunity. Abhimanyu Easwaran and Priyank Panchal must keep trying like Mayank Agarwal did. So either Rohit Sharma or Shubman Gill to open the batting. I suspect the team management is looking at Rohit and Gill gets to feel his way around the team. This cannot be a short-term call, India has to be ready to have Rohit opening in the away tours starting 2020. Been clearing. Books, once fresh, looking forlornly back at me through dusty covers, pleading to be kept. I look away from them. Everybody's time eventually comes.

Like Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma has benefited enormously from a period away from the public gaze in county cricket in England. Post the IPL next year, India should look to find county assignments for Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini and Mohd Siraj India would have liked more from the top order. The form of KL Rahul is now a worry and he could struggle to hold his place against South Africa. 2-0 as expected. India's bowlers were too powerful, too relentless. And Bumrah was outstanding.

Continues to flower in all respects. @captainshanky @gaurav_sundar But the question is: how does he find a spot in the top 5. For that, we will have to wait and see! @captainshanky @gaurav_sundar Very tempting to ask him to move up in India. Our history is full of middle order batsmen converted into openers. For every Sehwag who succeeded there were many who were lost . In an ideal development, Vihari plays in the top 5, Pant becomes good enough for 6 and Pandya goes to 7 @gaurav_sundar You can't play both Vihari and Pandya at the positions they are batting in now given there is also a keeper to accomodate because it will mean going in with three pure bowlers only There are so many ebbs and flows within a test innings. Hanuma Vihari has batted wonderfully to get into his 80s and suddenly it looks like there is no wind in his sails. But if he fights this phase, the flow will return. Hanuma Vihari is doing what good players do. Once they get a chance, they make it very difficult to drop them. Probably means that India play 2 spin + 2 pace in the home series When the opposition puts you in, has to bowl a spinner for 27 overs, you get 264-5 and have a bit of batting left, you've had a pretty good day Critical partnership between Vihari and Pant. This is the kind of resilience the lower middle order must show. And it is coming from two players making their future. It augurs well. @CricViz @cricvizanalyst Great...... Bit early?

You always play your key 7-8 players because they win you matches. They shouldn't be worried about selection unless they have an extended poor run or conditions are very slanted one way.. I see that structure returning in the 5 home tests. To continue, good sides have 3-4 other key players. For India, those are Rahane, Ishant, Shami and, if 2 spinners are used, Jadeja. That leaves 2 openers, a keeper and a no 6 (if only one spinner) all of whom are work in progress at varying levels of promise. https://t.co/BnNcaX5YvK India's test team is built on four pillars.

He realised he was rusty in the first innings, worked it out and produced a dramatic result in the second. #Champion @iamvaseem Yes, correct I didn't tweet on this game because I was unhappy at the time and I didn't want that to influence anything I might say. https://t.co/G3HqQ9ICam England showed yesterday, and New Zealand are showing today, that a game is always open. Would be happy to read informed views on these because I am just an observer and not an expert. In recent times, two brands I was proud of, and was an active customer of, have either failed or seem headed there. #CafeCoffeeDay and #JetAirways.  Hopefully, other entrepreneurs will learn and create great Indian brands that my great grand-children will be able to use. Having said that it bothers me that not enough big Indian entrepreneur driven brands have sufficient longevity. It worries me that growth, and continued success, seems linked to proximity to political power. Also the trend to take money out of the enterprise for a personal nest Very happy to see @EconomicTimes giving so much importance to the start-up space. My view is that the extent of entrepreneurship is an indicator of confidence in society.

It will be good for cricket, it will simplify things and make a simple judgement more accurate without stopping play. It will mean that the 3rd umpire will rule on every ball but it will only take him a few seconds. It will ensure that no-balls aren't by-passed and the umpire is free to focus in front of him rather than having to check the no-ball and quickly look up for the lbw or edge. Have long stated that the front foot no-ball call should be taken away from umpires.

By the way, the boundaries rule has been in place for a long time. It isn't 'fine print'. It's been used in the IPL. @sudhadudley Yes. If we had all agreed to the rules, yes.

Tells you how difficult it is to find one that everyone agrees upon! @suhel But the teams had agreed that it would be that way! RT @jimmaxcricket: @bhogleharsha The punditry seem to be sorer losers than the nz team who have behaved graciously generously in defeat. Ev\u2026 @bks89 Correct! There are many imponderables, many human frailties at work in sport. But that is how we play it.Everyone sits together,accepts the rules &amp; within them,somebody wins. This final has thrown up a certain kind of result. When emotions calm down,we can see if there is something better We accept so many things within a game. An lbw verdict where a projected path (a fine approximation but still an approximation!) determines that 48% of a ball was hitting a stump and not 51%. Remember these rules came out of the same process you will now subject this game too. Could it be decided by the no of wickets lost? Would that reduce flair and risk-taking? Could it be decided by no of runs minus extras? Does that paper over some deficiencies? Should a cricket match have joint winners if a super over is tied? Should the final of Wimbledon be decided by a tie-breaker? Should the final of a World Cup be decided by who scores more penalties? There are pluses and minuses with every system but teams and players are shown these and they agree to play within them. The counting of boundaries is not a new rule. It has been there for a long time. Remember, before the Super Over, World T20 games were won with players bowling to unguarded stumps! Maybe it is time to have a discussion over the playing conditions. But remember when the teams are asked if they want any changes, they accept the rules as they are. The easiest thing in the world is to rant about the rules. The most inconvenient thing is to subject your rant to the same rigour you expect from the rule. @scottbstyris @ICC Just curious. How would you have resolved it Scotty? Another super-over? No of wickets? Shared? @greatbong @vivekiyer20 Agree on the connotation but the originally meaning is still to 'steal a glance', isn't it? @greatbong @vivekiyer20 \"Bhogle using it\" doesn't necessarily mean it has to be correct! You recommend \"peek into the future\" then? But a peep originally meant a glance. Did the association come up later, you think? RT @juniorwaugh349: @TomMoodyCricket Agree totally.

England have played outstanding cricket over the last few overs and this will go a long way in the growth of white ball cricket there. England cap a phenomenal turnaround from 2015. Run-out off the last ball! There will never be another World Cup final like this. That catch. Then 15 from 4 balls and the fortuitous six. Trent Boult must wonder what cards life is dealing him. Super Over. Tie-breaker. Find me something, anything, that can come close to challenging live sport RT @chinmaybhogle: You've got to be kidding me. #WorldCupfinal Stokes, born in New Zealand, against New Zealand. This is redemption for the World T20 if ever it was possible Stokes and the last over! And Boult to correct his error. The last over of the best World Cup final. Two cliffhangers in one day. Who would have thought! Oh Federer, even the greatest feel the pressure... This is an excellent partnership. No nerves. Not taking chances. Perfect for England. Djokovic and England staging comebacks...... Don't think this is an easy track. If anything getting tougher. New Zealand are onto something big here. What a spell from Matt Henry. And the figures are unkind to Boult. Now, different challenge for New Zealand with the ball a bit older That was the closest umpire's call you would see. It was millimetres away from a first ball wicket. The first ten overs the key. New Zealand want wickets, England tend to go hard. Big session So how good is this New Zealand total?

Matt Henry was fantastic today but the performance of the match came from Ravindra Jadeja. He is my player of the match. Well done India fans. You lit up this World Cup. It would have been a lesser event without you. Well played New Zealand. You always punch above your weight in World Cups and that is why you are such an admired side around the world. Much respect. Once again. 2015. 2017. 2019. Impressive India fall in the pressure game. Valiant innings. A rare run-out in his last innings in a World Cup match. Fabulous innings from Jadeja. If hope flickers, it is because of him. He's had a great match Will Dhoni play the big shots now? Super over https://t.co/gmUTxs5Nke Are we onto something here? Nails left, anyone? I don't know how far this innings is going but Jadeja has played the innings of his life. And put a bit of pressure back on New Zealand Partnership 53. Still a long way off but happy to see the approach. Since he bats in the top order in Ranji Trophy cricket, Jadeja thinks like a batsman. Oh, Rishabh, patience throws up many opportunities. Was such a good innings till then. We came to the World Cup thinking we are going to see long T20 games, with scores around 350. Instead, we have seen short test matches. It has played out so differently , so fascinatingly Dhoni? Injured? Should be here otherwise. We've seen some great catches in this tournament but that from Neesham was the best This was the nightmare scenario for India. Now is the time for a good batting side to show its depth. Watching Jadeja in the field is such a thrill. Best in the game today. New Zealand's first target would have been 240. Would have liked 250. It is a tricky score given the pressures of a World Cup semi-final but India will be the happier side at this stage. @ManishPajan You have the academic credentials to understand it. Give it a shot. You would have studied fairly complex algorithms. I understand the logic, not the mathematics.

A very happy 70th to the great #SunilGavaskar. I use to switch the radio off if you got out. Wish you great health and many more years in the game you have so embellished. @krish_ramkumar @SudarshanEMA @ICC It is fair. The no is higher because you have ten wickets in hand. How cool is this.

Prudent decision. Forecast fine tomorrow https://t.co/T8y71pLZYg So play is officially called off for the day. Resumes tomorrow at the same score. I don't think India will mind that. And while we wait for play, how is this for a game of cricket. My friend, PV Jaishankar sent me this photograph from eastern Ladakh. And that is the Tso Moriri Lake in the background. https://t.co/SWGS85mTOe @BalajiKrish If you can't play today, restart from 211-5 tomorrow Covers off. Inspection at 18.10. If okay, play can restart upto 18.35 for a 20 over game. Target 148 if so. It's funny isn't it. You plan for years, play 9 tough games and then your hopes of a World Cup win and the resultant career high rest on an hour and a half of T20 equivalent cricket. Covers coming off. https://t.co/FmiI7NTlak The playing conditions say that if play cannot restart by the cut-off time for a result on the day (18.35 local time), play will be abandoned for the day and will restart the next day from the point at which it ended today. @anandmahindra It is tough to explain over 280 characters. It isn't as difficult as running a corporate empire!! Because you will have 10 wickets in hand when you start chasing the 20 over target. DLS calculates resources available. And so if you start on the assumption that it is 46 overs, then it gets aborted, the par score will only be 60-70 for no loss https://t.co/UVkQSMce0q The shorter the game, the stiffer the run-rate India will have to achieve. If it is a 20 over game now, the target would be 148. If, however, it becomes a 46 over game and India bat 20 overs, the target then will actually be just about 60-70 for no loss. The forecast has taken a turn for the worse, sadly. You can make up time upto two hours and all effort will be made to get a result today. Only goes into tomorrow if it isn't possible to end the game today. London is always great for shopping, and with my travel partner @RuPay_npci it\u2019s even more delightful. Visiting some truly exquisite stores this time. #RuPayTravelTales https://t.co/uS6IvaC81y Different contest as the ball gets older...... New Zealand's recent opening partnerships have been 0/12/0/5/29/2/1. Great ball, great catch Like @SGanguly99, I admit I am surprised by the dropping of Shami. He takes wickets upfront and if you do, the death overs aren't as critical. India batting very deep with Jadeja at 8 but it is a big call to leave out Kuldeep against a team he has done well. It is a good toss to win for New Zealand, especially on a knock-out today. But it doesn't change the assessment of India as favourites. RT @BLACKCAPS: \u201cA Semi-final is really exciting and there\u2019s plenty of fizz in the dressing room for today. Two wins and you win the tournam\u2026 Overcast. Lights on. Some rain forecast but don't think it will be enough to require play to go into a second day.

Very disappointed by New Zealand's steep decline at the World Cup. Will scrape through on NRR but don't see them troubling Australia in the semi-final. So England look like they have, rightly, won themselves a semi-final place. But there is a lot to play for here for NZ. Get the lower middle order scoring runs, their form might be crucial going ahead,  and drag the game as deep as possible to completely settle the NRR issue. @MailSport I don't know, I got it as a WhatsApp forward Really feel for #AmbatiRayudu. Always gave it everything he had but sometimes was left holding the wrong cards. So hope he continues in domestic white ball cricket so that we can see his wholehearted style of play in the #IPL. This is an emotional moment but there is a tomorrow Bangladesh are going for it. Showing good spirit here. They are one wicket away from the tail though! Good finish India have done well to keep chipping away at the Bangladesh wickets. It will irk them that there hasn't been a large enough partnership to challenge India. Game in favour of India at this stage @FahimAh09762587 Oops. Thanks India chipping away at the wickets. Mushfiq was a huge wicket. Pressure is shifting towards the batsmen and there could be an opportunity if the asking rate starts hovering around 8. Shakib the key. The two best Bangladesh bowlers Mustafizur and Shakib showed it isn't as easy to score runs off good bowling. India are the superior bowling side so they will bowl better but they are up against the best Bangladesh batting side I have known. Early wickets the key Afraid India haven't got the finish they wanted, they needed. Good score. But toe in the door for Bangladesh Top spell from a champion cricketer. Shakib has shown it is possible for spin to do well on this ground. Such a pleasure to be at the ground to see Rohit Sharma bat like this. Would have been even more fun if he had gone on. India's batsmen need to be careful not to get too influenced by the short boundary. We saw that at Lord's too when a couple of batsmen got out trying to clear the tiny boundary. We are coming to the tail-end of a major tournament. It is around now that a team should know it's best eleven. From that point of view, India must hope Dinesh Karthik comes good. The ground dimensions should not, in a World Cup game, decide the make-up of a team. India would have liked to play two spinners on this used surface. @official433 I don't know.

Catch Ep. 9 of #CricketFirstWithHarsh\u2026 England back on track. Too good a team to miss out. I don't see them losing to New Zealand now. Sadly for Sri Lankan fans, this result means their campaign is over. Disappointing finish. A run-a-ball partnership can't win games. Was exciting till Pandya was in. India seem to thrust Hardik Pandya into situations where he has to start hitting rightaway. He is a better player than that. I see him as India's no 5 in a year and a bit. @narayan140 The OneDay4Children logo Enjoying watching this. Irrespective of where this game goes (it is not Dhoni but Pandya who has the key to this game) we have had a spectacle. And we saw it. Excellent partnership. Love how Virat was willing Rohit on https://t.co/grOH1qBc9u It is very rare that you will see Rohit Sharma struggle like this, such is the fluency that he normally brings to his batting. Very keen to see how a champion player like him plays himself out of this phase I thought India were excellent in the middle overs. England looked good for 360 at one point. Strangely, the rut coincided with Bairstow's century. Rain alert in Mumbai, six alert in Birmingham..... Flattish deck. Can see why England were so keen to play Roy, especially with Bairstow struggling a bit. First look at the #MenInOrange.  Bright! So India confident enough to go with 5 bowlers and a bit of Jadhav and that means Vijay Shanker's utility is a bit reduced. Huge opportunity for Rishabh Pant. No 4 for your country is such a privilege.  I hope he goes well. So an extraordinary turn of events sees the entire sub-continent hoping, or should I say praying, for the same result!

But once again, it is down to the bowlers to play the bigger role. This is an excellent mid-innings spell from a proper quick bowler. Roach has shown up a little fragility in the Indian middle order. As a result, India behind where they would have liked to be. What is with the angst against Vijay Shanker and the hype around Rishabh Pant. VS has only batted twice, made 15* and 29, took a huge wicket at a difficult time against Pakistan and averages 11 more than RP in their short odi career. Give him a break, wish him well.

Hey England, can you allow us a glimpse of your summer this year? It is late June now and we come from warm lands........ Only one unbeaten team at this World Cup........ What a player this Babar Azam is. Still coming of age and already, by some distance, Pakistan's best batsman. And the selection of Haris Sohail is a game-changer. Santner looked like he would take a wicket with every ball in his first spell. He ends 10-0-38-0 and nobody, in a few days, will remember what a threat he was. I don't think too many people, including diehard home fans, would use the word 'clinical' to describe a Pakistan run-chase. But after the hiccups, that is what it has been. I wonder if the rest of the square at Edgbaston will be like this! India won't mind playing an extra spinner if so. This is an astonishing pitch And a catch goes down too. This is such a tense match. New Zealand missing their second spinner. https://t.co/OUzsm4N30N Pakistan have played and missed and edged but the runs in between have put them in a good position This is a staggering comeback from New Zealand and another chapter in the inspiring story of @JimmyNeesh.

And the dismissal doesn't change my view https://t.co/lCQNV0GFpd Fabulous innings from Nabi. So calm  Fantastic cricketer Another top over from Bumrah. 14 in the bank for India for Shami to defend. Kohli looking to Bumrah again.... https://t.co/mnKx6rTIDe I have so enjoyed watching this game. The run-rate not a factor, good old-fashioned runs and wickets. I don't think anyone thought, I certainly didn't, that Afghanistan would run this game so close. Tilted India's way but this game has made a lot of predictions look silly...... Kohli looks for Bumrah. Bumrah puts his hand up. Again. In spite of that wicket, this is a fine start from Afghanistan. Pressure is on.... https://t.co/hUpoNoc4ny Only a small total. India can't afford to give freebies in extras Well, was on the cards.... https://t.co/t3DGtQGVXu They have played and missed and played and missed but the openers have survived somehow! Have to admire the manner in which the Afghanistan spinners controlled a high quality batting line up. Used the pace of the pitch very well and that meant Dhoni and Jadhav preferred to play them out rather than attack them This is gettable for Afghanistan but if they get do it will be after a big struggle;  they will have to display the self-belief they haven't shown so far. Tough pitch to bat on. A spot of bother for India. Will test 5,6,7 now. Remember, it is a long tail today without Bhuvi. Need 250. @ThanduMadurai Except of course the part where he pointed out his excellent record in the few times he has batted there!! Sluggish surface. The two previous games here produced 212 and 227 in the 1st innings. You can see why in the way the batsmen have had to approach the bowling.

I think the semi-final is just about putting the key in the lock And so, another one-sided #INDvPAK contest. Other than hoping to get in through D/L at one stage, Pakistan were never in the hunt. @DuteeChand And so, may they continue talking about you, may you continue training and bring glory to India. India's selection has been spot on. Have to hand it to Kohli. Playing Bhuvi ahead of Shami at the start of the World Cup and staying with Kuldeep today. Rain forecast in a while. Even on D/L this game is now beyond reach of Pakistan. Ball of the match from Kuldeep. Babar was looking good.The drift and turn are what a wrist spinner dreams of. Big partnership this. Few overs ago looked like Fakhar was fidgety but that phase has passed. Hopefully that 6pm shower forecast (10.30 Ind time) will not decide the game on D/L The Bhuvi injury is a big blow. With rain in the air, wickets the key. Now that the game has started D/L will favour the side batting second in a curtailed game if they have wickets in hand.

Dhawan looking excellent, Virat just a bit edgy......Australia concerned about how to get overs from bowlers 4&amp;5 out....... Big part of this match. Starc and Cummins vs Rohit and Shikhar.

Works both ways. You can tell yourself it was the umpires but that would mean you are unwilling to look at the real reason. @pakwakankar On Gayle and the no-ball, yes. But on another day he would have been bowled when the ball hit the stump. Yes, the umpires had an off day but that wasn't the reason the West Indies lost. At important moments, Australia were the better side. Starc was magnificent as were the lower order batsmen who took them to 288.

Some poor decisions have cost them 2 points. Holder is playing a fine innings. Brathwaite has to put him back in strike at every opportunity. I fear the West Indies are making it tougher for themselves. If Russell was batting in the 45th over, the game was done This match has been a celebration of fast short pitched bowling on a ground where 400 has been scored a few times! The Umpire Strikes Back. Eventually. #Gayle. Stunning. Just stunning, that catch from Cottrell. Deserves two salutes! So.........nobody likes bounce.....#AUSvWI Great fun watching these West Indies quicks. Oshane Thomas looks very uneasy to face and Cottrell, apart from the best celebration in the game, is a fine bowler too.
