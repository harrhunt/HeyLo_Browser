The most encouraging thing for India is that the wickets have been shared between the quicks and the spinners. It means there is always a wicket-taking bowler that the captain to turn to There is a lot of talk around the world about pitches in India. It is time to bury that because the last few wins have all come on normal pitches. Here in Ranchi, Saha collected a ball over his head on the 4th morning! A great catch and a bizarre dismissal this morning. But it took only 9 mins and 2 overs to produce India's biggest win over South Africa India's win today will make it 26 wins out of 32 matches played at home. Of these 26 wins, the closest has been 6 wickets or 75 runs.

De Bruyn confirmed as a concussion sub https://t.co/kjp5Cid81x Dane Piedt in now. There is a protocol to be followed for the naming of a concussion substitute. Once that is done de Bruyn will probably bat. Gets worse for South Africa. Elgar can't resume his innings so it is Klassen and Linde already. Maybe it is effectively 26-5 but more important, hope Elgar recovers soon. For someone who has admired South African cricket greatly, this is inexplicable. I know there are many issues but none that can explain this capitulation South Africa's best batting phase. The 9th wicket is the most productive partnership and the ball, after 45 overs, is softer There is no perceptible change in Jadeja's release between the one that turns and the other that goes straight through. That is why he is such a threat on a turning track. The Hamza and Klaasen dismissals were vintage spin bowling. So much opportunity around. A debutant bowling to two others!

Parat bhetuya. A world record 11 successive series wins at home for India. Shows you why playing away in India is one of the toughest assignments going. Meanwhile some pretty threatening clouds have gathered over the stadium........ By the manner in which Agarwal and Pujara batted, and then Kohli and Rahane, India were able to justify their decision of going in with five bowlers and playing a batsman short.. Each of those five pitched in. And then, Saha was magnificent. This is a quality Indian team. India's biggest win over South Africa. Been better at all aspects. And the series has been won, not on minefields, but on perfectly good tracks. This one in Pune was excellent. @hershybru Haha! You scored too many against India so was good to bring that up! Over the years, I have had enormous admiration for South Africa as a cricketing nation. And as India's toughest opponent, whether home or way. These performances will take some time to come to terms with. India's bowlers have been very well supported behind the stumps. Two beauties from Saha and now a wonderful slip catch from Rahane. No, Sagar, we were pointing out how difficult it is for the non-striker and how hard it is on him. https://t.co/UzMGCnGOOq Absolutely brilliant new ball bowling from India this morning.

This is a fine effort How good has Shami been today. Has hit the stumps three times. India has so many bowlers to turn to now.

They will need a much better day tomorrow All the talk before the game was about Rohit Sharma, the opener. All the talk now is about Rohit Sharma, the opener. A century on his first opportunity is a nice way to say \"I'm here\" Just about perfect session for India. Win toss bat first. Negotiate the brief period while the new ball is threatening. Go hard at the spinners. Build a solid platform. So often, the first session of a test has a bearing on the series.

Was he a test player &amp; therefore not picked originally for the World Cup? Is he now an odi player &amp; so not in the test XI? Or is this a call on his confidence level? With Hanuma Vihari as the specialist batsman at 6 and with Ashwin and Jadeja perfectly capable batsmen, India could look at pure keeping skills for the home series. And while Pant is hugely promising, he too will be aware that Saha is currently the better keeper on turning tracks The decision to have Saha keep wickets in the home tests is a clear signal on the kind of wickets that we can expect and therefore, the kind of skills needed. There was never any doubt that Saha is the best keeper in the country, the call was always about Pant and the future RT @aparanjape: Today is the 100th birth anniversary of Gaj\u0101nan Digambar M\u0101dgu\u1e37kar.

There was a time when the job of the openers was to see off the new ball. Now, almost everywhere in test cricket, the new ball is seeing off the openers. Never tire of watching @ShaneWarne bowl.

KL Rahul has to go back to domestic cricket and that may not be so bad for him. And I think the selectors have been prudent with Hardik Pandya given recent fitness issues. The arrival of Vihari &amp; the fact that the next five tests are in India probably made it tough anyway Either way it is hard on the two players who have scored runs everytime they have been given an opportunity. Abhimanyu Easwaran and Priyank Panchal must keep trying like Mayank Agarwal did. So either Rohit Sharma or Shubman Gill to open the batting. I suspect the team management is looking at Rohit and Gill gets to feel his way around the team. This cannot be a short-term call, India has to be ready to have Rohit opening in the away tours starting 2020. Been clearing.

Post the IPL next year, India should look to find county assignments for Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini and Mohd Siraj India would have liked more from the top order. The form of KL Rahul is now a worry and he could struggle to hold his place against South Africa. 2-0 as expected. India's bowlers were too powerful, too relentless. And Bumrah was outstanding.

For that, we will have to wait and see! @captainshanky @gaurav_sundar Very tempting to ask him to move up in India. Our history is full of middle order batsmen converted into openers. For every Sehwag who succeeded there were many who were lost . In an ideal development, Vihari plays in the top 5, Pant becomes good enough for 6 and Pandya goes to 7 @gaurav_sundar You can't play both Vihari and Pandya at the positions they are batting in now given there is also a keeper to accomodate because it will mean going in with three pure bowlers only There are so many ebbs and flows within a test innings. Hanuma Vihari has batted wonderfully to get into his 80s and suddenly it looks like there is no wind in his sails. But if he fights this phase, the flow will return. Hanuma Vihari is doing what good players do. Once they get a chance, they make it very difficult to drop them. Probably means that India play 2 spin + 2 pace in the home series When the opposition puts you in, has to bowl a spinner for 27 overs, you get 264-5 and have a bit of batting left, you've had a pretty good day Critical partnership between Vihari and Pant. This is the kind of resilience the lower middle order must show. And it is coming from two players making their future. It augurs well. @CricViz @cricvizanalyst Great...... Bit early?

Numbers don't have to be at the expense of stories unless the stories have been subject to much exaggeration (which happens very often). And memories are subject to bias. Finally, instinct. Analytics sharpens it, doesn't dilute it. @mediagag It is my hypothesis, and your numbers could cast light on it, that the way a country plays its cricket, especially test cricket, is a reflection of the state of the country. Intuition says there should be a lag between the two. Is there a correlation in Pakistan cricket? Excellent Hassan. And Mazher.

Otherwise, why change? In cricket, analytics is taking us beyond the world of mere hypothesis, often the outcome of insufficient  viewing. We have all been guilty of this &amp; have been pulled up by insights that analytics is producing. I can only imagine the influence it can have in more critical spheres I must admit I know folks at @thoughtspot &amp; that is because I am fascinated by where the world of analytics is headed &amp; its role in generating new insights &amp; in decision making.

It's the Kohli production line. It's smooth and it's efficient. And it's delightfully predictable. This is a half century of great class and composure from Shreyas Iyer. Loved the big shots but just as much, the easily taken singles. Has taken a lot of pressure off Kohli. This is a shot that Rishabh Pant will want to forget but shouldn't. It should remind him of how much ability he is wasting. He is a batsman-keeper, not the other way around, so his batting must speak for him even more. RT @chintskap: Remembering Shammi Kapoor.

It will be good for cricket, it will simplify things and make a simple judgement more accurate without stopping play. It will mean that the 3rd umpire will rule on every ball but it will only take him a few seconds. It will ensure that no-balls aren't by-passed and the umpire is free to focus in front of him rather than having to check the no-ball and quickly look up for the lbw or edge. Have long stated that the front foot no-ball call should be taken away from umpires.

I can understand that if you are asked a question, you answer it but the moment the question was asked, somebody should have said that the selection process is on and so, it wouldn't be right for him to answer it.

But like with all players, it is the selectors who must take a call on his future as an India player. But this call must emerge from discussion with Dhoni. The greats command that respect. At his peak, Dhoni would never have taken 2 months off to train with the Territorial Army. But as with all of us, priorities change. We should have a clear direction by September when SA is here. But hopefully the selectors have been talking to him and we don't need to speculate. You've got to feel for the cricketers in Zimbabwe. They were fighting the odds, their administration was a shambles, but at least they were playing, their scores were recorded, there was something to look forward to. I do hope it gets resolved soon. @zoransaher Thanks Zoran. That is kind of you. The Afternoon Despatch and Courier will always be associated with the legendary Busybee.

RT @jimmaxcricket: @bhogleharsha The punditry seem to be sorer losers than the nz team who have behaved graciously generously in defeat. Ev\u2026 @bks89 Correct! There are many imponderables, many human frailties at work in sport. But that is how we play it.Everyone sits together,accepts the rules &amp; within them,somebody wins. This final has thrown up a certain kind of result. When emotions calm down,we can see if there is something better We accept so many things within a game. An lbw verdict where a projected path (a fine approximation but still an approximation!) determines that 48% of a ball was hitting a stump and not 51%. Remember these rules came out of the same process you will now subject this game too. Could it be decided by the no of wickets lost? Would that reduce flair and risk-taking? Could it be decided by no of runs minus extras? Does that paper over some deficiencies? Should a cricket match have joint winners if a super over is tied? Should the final of Wimbledon be decided by a tie-breaker? Should the final of a World Cup be decided by who scores more penalties? There are pluses and minuses with every system but teams and players are shown these and they agree to play within them. The counting of boundaries is not a new rule. It has been there for a long time. Remember, before the Super Over, World T20 games were won with players bowling to unguarded stumps! Maybe it is time to have a discussion over the playing conditions. But remember when the teams are asked if they want any changes, they accept the rules as they are. The easiest thing in the world is to rant about the rules. The most inconvenient thing is to subject your rant to the same rigour you expect from the rule. @scottbstyris @ICC Just curious. How would you have resolved it Scotty? Another super-over? No of wickets? Shared? @greatbong @vivekiyer20 Agree on the connotation but the originally meaning is still to 'steal a glance', isn't it? @greatbong @vivekiyer20 \"Bhogle using it\" doesn't necessarily mean it has to be correct!

Run-out off the last ball! There will never be another World Cup final like this. That catch. Then 15 from 4 balls and the fortuitous six. Trent Boult must wonder what cards life is dealing him. Super Over. Tie-breaker.

This is redemption for the World T20 if ever it was possible Stokes and the last over! And Boult to correct his error. The last over of the best World Cup final. Two cliffhangers in one day. Who would have thought! Oh Federer, even the greatest feel the pressure... This is an excellent partnership. No nerves. Not taking chances. Perfect for England. Djokovic and England staging comebacks...... Don't think this is an easy track. If anything getting tougher. New Zealand are onto something big here. What a spell from Matt Henry. And the figures are unkind to Boult. Now, different challenge for New Zealand with the ball a bit older That was the closest umpire's call you would see. It was millimetres away from a first ball wicket. The first ten overs the key. New Zealand want wickets, England tend to go hard. Big session So how good is this New Zealand total?

Matt Henry was fantastic today but the performance of the match came from Ravindra Jadeja. He is my player of the match. Well done India fans. You lit up this World Cup. It would have been a lesser event without you. Well played New Zealand. You always punch above your weight in World Cups and that is why you are such an admired side around the world. Much respect. Once again. 2015. 2017. 2019. Impressive India fall in the pressure game. Valiant innings. A rare run-out in his last innings in a World Cup match. Fabulous innings from Jadeja. If hope flickers, it is because of him. He's had a great match Will Dhoni play the big shots now? Super over https://t.co/gmUTxs5Nke Are we onto something here? Nails left, anyone? I don't know how far this innings is going but Jadeja has played the innings of his life. And put a bit of pressure back on New Zealand Partnership 53. Still a long way off but happy to see the approach. Since he bats in the top order in Ranji Trophy cricket, Jadeja thinks like a batsman. Oh, Rishabh, patience throws up many opportunities. Was such a good innings till then. We came to the World Cup thinking we are going to see long T20 games, with scores around 350. Instead, we have seen short test matches. It has played out so differently , so fascinatingly Dhoni? Injured? Should be here otherwise. We've seen some great catches in this tournament but that from Neesham was the best This was the nightmare scenario for India. Now is the time for a good batting side to show its depth. Watching Jadeja in the field is such a thrill. Best in the game today. New Zealand's first target would have been 240. Would have liked 250. It is a tricky score given the pressures of a World Cup semi-final but India will be the happier side at this stage. @ManishPajan You have the academic credentials to understand it. Give it a shot. You would have studied fairly complex algorithms. I understand the logic, not the mathematics. It is not difficult. https://t.co/x8SSxJmQkR @krish_ramkumar @SudarshanEMA @ICC Once India begin their reply, their D/L par score after 20 overs will be around 60-70 for no loss on the same principle. A very happy 70th to the great #SunilGavaskar. I use to switch the radio off if you got out. Wish you great health and many more years in the game you have so embellished. @krish_ramkumar @SudarshanEMA @ICC It is fair. The no is higher because you have ten wickets in hand. How cool is this.

Prudent decision. Forecast fine tomorrow https://t.co/T8y71pLZYg So play is officially called off for the day. Resumes tomorrow at the same score. I don't think India will mind that. And while we wait for play, how is this for a game of cricket. My friend, PV Jaishankar sent me this photograph from eastern Ladakh. And that is the Tso Moriri Lake in the background. https://t.co/SWGS85mTOe @BalajiKrish If you can't play today, restart from 211-5 tomorrow Covers off. Inspection at 18.10. If okay, play can restart upto 18.35 for a 20 over game. Target 148 if so. It's funny isn't it. You plan for years, play 9 tough games and then your hopes of a World Cup win and the resultant career high rest on an hour and a half of T20 equivalent cricket. Covers coming off. https://t.co/FmiI7NTlak The playing conditions say that if play cannot restart by the cut-off time for a result on the day (18.35 local time), play will be abandoned for the day and will restart the next day from the point at which it ended today. @anandmahindra It is tough to explain over 280 characters. It isn't as difficult as running a corporate empire!! Because you will have 10 wickets in hand when you start chasing the 20 over target. DLS calculates resources available. And so if you start on the assumption that it is 46 overs, then it gets aborted, the par score will only be 60-70 for no loss https://t.co/UVkQSMce0q The shorter the game, the stiffer the run-rate India will have to achieve. If it is a 20 over game now, the target would be 148. If, however, it becomes a 46 over game and India bat 20 overs, the target then will actually be just about 60-70 for no loss. The forecast has taken a turn for the worse, sadly. You can make up time upto two hours and all effort will be made to get a result today. Only goes into tomorrow if it isn't possible to end the game today. London is always great for shopping, and with my travel partner @RuPay_npci it\u2019s even more delightful. Visiting some truly exquisite stores this time. #RuPayTravelTales https://t.co/uS6IvaC81y Different contest as the ball gets older...... New Zealand's recent opening partnerships have been 0/12/0/5/29/2/1. Great ball, great catch Like @SGanguly99, I admit I am surprised by the dropping of Shami. He takes wickets upfront and if you do, the death overs aren't as critical. India batting very deep with Jadeja at 8 but it is a big call to leave out Kuldeep against a team he has done well. It is a good toss to win for New Zealand, especially on a knock-out today. But it doesn't change the assessment of India as favourites. RT @BLACKCAPS: \u201cA Semi-final is really exciting and there\u2019s plenty of fizz in the dressing room for today. Two wins and you win the tournam\u2026 Overcast. Lights on.

So England look like they have, rightly, won themselves a semi-final place. But there is a lot to play for here for NZ.

Always gave it everything he had but sometimes was left holding the wrong cards. So hope he continues in domestic white ball cricket so that we can see his wholehearted style of play in the #IPL. This is an emotional moment but there is a tomorrow Bangladesh are going for it. Showing good spirit here. They are one wicket away from the tail though! Good finish India have done well to keep chipping away at the Bangladesh wickets. It will irk them that there hasn't been a large enough partnership to challenge India. Game in favour of India at this stage @FahimAh09762587 Oops. Thanks India chipping away at the wickets. Mushfiq was a huge wicket. Pressure is shifting towards the batsmen and there could be an opportunity if the asking rate starts hovering around 8. Shakib the key. The two best Bangladesh bowlers Mustafizur and Shakib showed it isn't as easy to score runs off good bowling. India are the superior bowling side so they will bowl better but they are up against the best Bangladesh batting side I have known. Early wickets the key Afraid India haven't got the finish they wanted, they needed. Good score. But toe in the door for Bangladesh Top spell from a champion cricketer. Shakib has shown it is possible for spin to do well on this ground. Such a pleasure to be at the ground to see Rohit Sharma bat like this. Would have been even more fun if he had gone on. India's batsmen need to be careful not to get too influenced by the short boundary. We saw that at Lord's too when a couple of batsmen got out trying to clear the tiny boundary. We are coming to the tail-end of a major tournament. It is around now that a team should know it's best eleven. From that point of view, India must hope Dinesh Karthik comes good. The ground dimensions should not, in a World Cup game, decide the make-up of a team. India would have liked to play two spinners on this used surface. @official433 I don't know.

Sadly for Sri Lankan fans, this result means their campaign is over. Disappointing finish. A run-a-ball partnership can't win games. Was exciting till Pandya was in.

Love how Virat was willing Rohit on https://t.co/grOH1qBc9u It is very rare that you will see Rohit Sharma struggle like this, such is the fluency that he normally brings to his batting. Very keen to see how a champion player like him plays himself out of this phase I thought India were excellent in the middle overs. England looked good for 360 at one point. Strangely, the rut coincided with Bairstow's century. Rain alert in Mumbai, six alert in Birmingham..... Flattish deck. Can see why England were so keen to play Roy, especially with Bairstow struggling a bit. First look at the #MenInOrange.  Bright! So India confident enough to go with 5 bowlers and a bit of Jadhav and that means Vijay Shanker's utility is a bit reduced. Huge opportunity for Rishabh Pant. No 4 for your country is such a privilege.  I hope he goes well. So an extraordinary turn of events sees the entire sub-continent hoping, or should I say praying, for the same result!

Old Trafford was excellent and you have to acknowledge the enthusiasm and the intensity of the supporters. Fantastic. No. 4 is still an issue but every team has one. It is how you play around it that matters and India aren't letting it get in the way. India were dominant, powerful and relentless. Who knows about tomorrow, but today they are playing like champions. Just like you  go into ecstacy over a great cover drive so must you over the ball that got Hope out. This spell by Shami is of the highest class Not pro or anti anybody. Excited by Pant. But once Shanker was picked, had to be fair to him. India have time after this game to look at options. https://t.co/Rc1nAfO0l8 He always gets the finish....... India have a decent score eventually. But once again, it is down to the bowlers to play the bigger role. This is an excellent mid-innings spell from a proper quick bowler. Roach has shown up a little fragility in the Indian middle order. As a result, India behind where they would have liked to be. What is with the angst against Vijay Shanker and the hype around Rishabh Pant. VS has only batted twice, made 15* and 29, took a huge wicket at a difficult time against Pakistan and averages 11 more than RP in their short odi career. Give him a break, wish him well. No surprise India unchanged and choosing to bat. Best contest of the match coming up. The West Indies quicks take more wickets than others in the 1st powerplay but India lose fewer wickets than anyone else.

Hey England, can you allow us a glimpse of your summer this year? It is late June now and we come from warm lands........ Only one unbeaten team at this World Cup........ What a player this Babar Azam is. Still coming of age and already, by some distance, Pakistan's best batsman. And the selection of Haris Sohail is a game-changer. Santner looked like he would take a wicket with every ball in his first spell. He ends 10-0-38-0 and nobody, in a few days, will remember what a threat he was. I don't think too many people, including diehard home fans, would use the word 'clinical' to describe a Pakistan run-chase. But after the hiccups, that is what it has been. I wonder if the rest of the square at Edgbaston will be like this! India won't mind playing an extra spinner if so. This is an astonishing pitch And a catch goes down too. This is such a tense match. New Zealand missing their second spinner. https://t.co/OUzsm4N30N Pakistan have played and missed and edged but the runs in between have put them in a good position This is a staggering comeback from New Zealand and another chapter in the inspiring story of @JimmyNeesh.

Have to admire the manner in which the Afghanistan spinners controlled a high quality batting line up. Used the pace of the pitch very well and that meant Dhoni and Jadhav preferred to play them out rather than attack them This is gettable for Afghanistan but if they get do it will be after a big struggle;  they will have to display the self-belief they haven't shown so far. Tough pitch to bat on. A spot of bother for India. Will test 5,6,7 now. Remember, it is a long tail today without Bhuvi. Need 250. @ThanduMadurai Except of course the part where he pointed out his excellent record in the few times he has batted there!! Sluggish surface.

With rain in the air, wickets the key. Now that the game has started D/L will favour the side batting second in a curtailed game if they have wickets in hand.

Congrats to the Indian Men\u2019s Recurve Archery team as they beat Canada 5-3 &amp; enter the QF #ArcheryWorldChampio\u2026 Had said in my World Cup preview that Australia were vulnerable if Stoinis were to be absent because they had three reserve bowlers and one reserve bat, neither of whom had a significant second skill Incredible fightback from Pakistan. Have scored 94-1 in the last 12. Game on still... I suspect Finch is already looking around for bowling options. This isn't the scariest Aussie bowling line-up... This is a decent start by Pakistan. Maybe one wicket more than ideal for them but at the moment, they are pacing the chase well. Interesting that Warner talks about bowling a test match length. But they are about 30 behind where it seemed they would finish. 70-30 to Australia at this stage. Pakistan need to be 100/120-1 to mount a serious challenge. RT @joybhattacharj: One Pakistan team turned up against the West Indies, a completely different looking side against England. Today, both h\u2026 This flurry of wickets at the end has given Pakistan a glimmer. It is still a daunting total but Amir has brought them back. #AUSvPAK Has anyone else noticed that every non-striker is behind the crease when the ball is bowled? Everytime. As it should be. So hopefully the era of running less for a run is over. Mohd Amir is showing his pedigree today. He always had it but turned up in disguise too often. But class comes through. Good to see play on for now in Taunton. Both teams similarly structured. Four quicks and someone who can bowl off-breaks. Important game for both On a train to Nottingham.

Maybe, hopefully, this will prompt a relook.

RT @cricbuzz: India had a lot of positives from their win over Australia feels @bhogleharsha as he analyses the game alongside @collinsadam\u2026 The Oval was blue today. With every passing year the proportion of Indians in the crowd grows. This was almost unreal today The 86 off 44 balls between Pandya, Dhoni and Rahul was probably the difference eventually. And I thought Bhuvneshwar was excellent. I was a sceptic, to be honest, but delighted for him. Top win for India. Batsmen provided a safe total and in intervals, which is important to recognise, the bowling was excellent. This is a powerful performance and reminiscent of the start in 2015. Game on. Maxwell is changing the course of the game. India need Bhuvneshwar to bowl a tight spell here. Won't be easy, there is little movement for him @GabbbarSingh Not just the hundred he got but the role he played in easing the other two into their innings. Brings a smile. @cricbuzz. #CricbuzzLIVE https://t.co/9p6aqXAktp Have to believe this is enough for India This is a powerful batting statement by India Don't underestimate the importance of the Dhawan innings. Allowed Rohit and Kohli to ease themselves in and set the scene for Pandya. The ebbs and flows of a 50 over game.
