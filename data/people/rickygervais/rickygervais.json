It's used to indicate obligation, duty, or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions. Without free will there is no culpability. @Tomaz79 @timminchin Without free will the word \"should\" makes no sense. @TheJohnnyLawler @timminchin @ecoBassie Defending yourself against someone who is trying to torture you to death is a good thing to do. @timminchin @ecoBassie Basically, we're not so much celebrating the death of the torturer, but rather the survival of the innocent. We acknowledge a natural justice. @timminchin @ecoBassie Particularly in this case when the bull was almost certainly still killed too. @timminchin @ecoBassie I think it's purely the term 'celebrate' that's stopping us from being in total agreement to be honest. It's a very frivolous word for any moral conundrum. @timminchin @ecoBassie Sure. But I guess I'm saying it is ok to celebrate an innocent  victim of attempted murder surviving by any necessary means against their attacker. This was my original point :) @rezpublika So torturing a bull to death is less cruel than hurting the feelings of the torturers family? Interesting. @timminchin @ecoBassie The bullfighter wasn't executed though. He was killed in self defence. If you were kidnapped and being tortured to death but you managed to escape by killing your captor, we should celebrate \ud83e\udd42 A lovely added bonus that has come with the global success of #AfterLife is so many people discovering or rewatching my older stuff such as #Derek and #Humanity.

I do it all the time. But a small majority of racists DO use it to justify their bigotry. They muddy the water. @reasonvalues @s0n_dam @soul_mandy Of course. But unfortunately that doesn't mean that everyone who hates Islam isn't also racist.
