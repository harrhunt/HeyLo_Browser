Some surprises to come. And hopefully some great performances. Let me knowwhat YOU think and who you like. I have loved working on the X Factor this year. It's all about the talent. Over the next few weeks things get interesting. Snobby, ignorant or bitter? Why do some snotty people who have had huge careers knock bands like the boys and then say but I haven't heard their records Loved seeing One Direction at the O2 last night. It meant a lot to them. You could see that. You guys know of my hatred of animal cruelty and this has shocked me I have just heard about the cruelty to dolphins in Japan, with 1000s facing horrific slaughter in the coming months \u00a1Comienza la b\u00fasqueda!

Great singers in this category, but I would be keen to see how another judge would do with the overs this year! I mentored the overs last year and had the winner and the runner up. I had a great holiday. And now back to work. Sorry. I should have said Saturday and Sunday. As always thank you for watching our show on Saturday. Hope you enjoyed it. And I do listen to you! Love the boys category but I had three guys in my Overs last year, it would be more fun to mentor something different .@Cherylofficial had them last year but I've not mentored the girls since Leona, and look what happened! #SimonGirls I would love to mentor the girls this year. Have you voted for #SimonGroups yet? I do have the best track record with the groups after all\u2026none of the others can do a better job The girls category needs an expert and that\u2019s me!

I have know idea what the show will look like but I feel both excited and nervous. It's going to be very different! Embrace the madness.. We have always had great judges. And I will always be thankful for their passion and expertise. We met a lot of people. I really believe everyone on the show this year is excited about finding someone who has star potential. The best kept secret in TV is out!! But I am really happy with the new judging line up for XFactor this year. Its going to be a lot of fun And today had one of the most delicious ice creams (strawberry) I have ever had. I think the place is called The Ice Cream lab. Still in LA. We had dinner with the very talented David Foster and his wife Yolanda last night. He co wrote I Have Nothing and tons more. @Kazsugarman wishing @LeadBellyFest a great night in support of @SSChospices And back to the UK where we  like working on X Factor this new@LittleMix single Black Magic is looking huge.

Just wanted to say hello. Depending on where you are good night or good morning. A bit late. But thank you to everyone who watched Britains Got Talent this year. I really loved this series. It's been a quiet three days! @BeachSnob I haven't forgotten I haven't forgotten RT @BeachSnob: @SimonCowell Yadda yadda - Simon its so frustrating when u preach &amp; don't follow thru what happened 2 the dolphin project? \"\u2026 And now it's time to say goodnight. Thank you for letting me know what you are thinking. I have great followers. The ones I can help. Not being defensive. I appreciate your concern and happy you care about animals. My last thought is cruelty to animals beyond belief has been bought to my attention. If you care your concern can do much more good. As animal lovers I will always listen to your views. I would never allow any animal to be treated in a cruel way. But care that you care. We asked the RSPCA to see Wendy in rehearsals and I was told she was happy and looked after well. I believe if you can show that animals have personalities more people will hopefully respect them and show compassion. I thought a lot about the dog act on our show tonight. It's no secret I love animals. I think the show tonight is going to be interesting! Hello I agree the new @LittleMix single is one of their best. And the video is fantastic. RT @5SecondsofBSB: @SimonCowell have you bought #BlackMagic by @LittleMix on iTunes yet? They are xfactor alum and the song is incredible Her song about Space was just terrible.

The home visit shows start. It's a great record and @Labrinthda1st, as I've already said, is a super talented guy Hello. They are a hard working bunch who weren't aware of the growing concern regarding dolphins. I want to send this out regarding the Xtra Factor team. I think you all know my view on cruelty to animals so thank you all for your concern. Reading your tweets. I had no idea Xtra Factor producers filmed with dolphins. This will NOT be showed on Saturday. I am learning! @FifthHarmony are going to be huge this year. I can feel it. @LittleMix are working on a new album. We are totally committed to them. They have got better and better. @onedirection have delivered an amazing album and the new single Is getting an incredible reaction. I have just been lectured on how to tweet properly. So will try again! Like I always say the fans for all these bands should take the credit you deserve for your constant support. Fifth Harmony are going to be huge this year. I can feel it. Little Mix are working on a new album. We are totally committed to them. They have got better and better.

Unbelievable! Donation on its way. An amazing night with One Direction tonight. The show was great and a fantastic audience. And what's truly special. Their loyalty. So my opinion is just one as a friend. At the same time you have to respect everyone's opinions. It's such an important decision. I know I don't live in Scotland. But I would be sad if we don't stay together. I always like the feeling of being united. Currently in New York and then back to LA to see One Direction on Friday. Oops meant to say Americas Got Talent final next week. Am really looking forward to the Americas Got Talent next. And could be the closest yet. It's been a great series. I do love this show. So the numbers are in. Strictly peak 9.4. X Factor peak 9.2. Round one to them. Such a shame they were both on at the same time!

Sorry and should have mentioned Paul who should have made the finals last year. Louis!!! The highlights of last nights X Factor to me were Ben Monica and Lola. And we got a glimpse of some other really good people. I am so sad to hear about the news Simone Battle has passed away. She was such a fun nice person. It's such a loss. Rest in peace Simone. Hope you enjoy tonight's show. Some very good auditions. And I really like Jay. Nice guys can do well. Love Chloe Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh Are you watching? Am really happy Fifth Harmony won VMA'S artist to watch. Congratulations to Collabro on their number one album. Very happy for you. The boys are having the best time.

Mel B is a total star. She flew in from New York last night. No sleep. And totally on it. She is a revelation. Last day of X factor auditions today before we start the arena shows tomorrow. 2 amazing auditions.  Both 17. A boy and a girl. Compare that to a driver whining on Sunday because his team couldn't get his team mate to let him overtake him. I watched a documentary on the plane about James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Amazing. Total respect for each other. Bars and Melody number 2 in the charts after one day. That's a result. Back home. While I was away we replaced the grass in my garden with fake grass. Horrendous.

More details at @icantsingUK And seriously expect the unexpected! It's difficult to describe because I have never seen anything like it before. I hope you love it as much as I do. Hello. Am very excited and relieved to confirm the first public preview for #ICantSingUk the X Factor musical is tonight. @terriseymour the most clumsy person on the planet!

Nicole will always be a part of the X factor family. Now signed to Sony as an artist. Thank you Nicole for everything. And I hope to share some very very exciting news with you next week. And of course good luck to my lil buddy Demi. A big supporter of acts on the show. Wishing little mix and fifth harmony good luck tonight in la. On tour with my buddy Demi. The Alex and Sierra early tracks are fantastic. I have huge faith in these two. And to anyone considering applying for X factor this year. Do it. We are taking this year very seriously. It's all about the talent We saw some brilliant acts today at the London britains got talent auditions. Very happy. And I have to thank the incredible fans reactions. Appreciate every message. Thought I should try and explain what really happened. Both fox and us made the decision to protect a very important brand to us. Sometimes we rest these shows in other countries. And that's what we did in a crowded market. In most cases the show returned stronger. The last time I appeared on X factor uk it resulted in over 45 million record sales. So I decided last year to return home to the uk show. Not quite sure who \"offered\" X factor USA to a rival network. It wasn't my company. There will always be speculation about these things. Hi. Am with @Stephenmulhern at britains got talent.Has no followers on twitter. Can you help? We found some amazing talent. And now the search begins to find the next star. That's why we make these shows. I have had a blast. Really the best time of my life. Thank you for the support and the fun we have had together. It's never forgotten. You realise how much you owe to the fans who have supported all of the shows we made in both countries. Today was a day of mixed emotions. Excited to confirm me returning to the Uk X factor and sad to leave America. Some of my friends went to see the new Lego movie last night. All saying its genius. I just got back from bit auditions in Birmingham. Really good and really strange. Lowlight was a dancing owl. Who didn't. I have just been told that the new little mix album is number one on the us iTunes album chart. That is bloody fantastic. Congratulations Loved X Factor Italia. Now you'll be able to watch Got Talent on Sky. Have fun Italy! My friend Katie Piper has a new show on tonight. It's on channel 4 at ten pm. I heard it's really good. I was thinking on the flight how many great records there were last year. The music business feels exciting again. No rules. Apart from the smallest film library in the world everything else was great. I flew British airways. Went to watch a movie in their movie library section. You can choose from four movies. Almost too many. I just got back from New York to London. Had a great trip. And my dogs went crazy when I walked in the front door. A great feeling Or the Brits? It seems crazy they don't. Is there a reason? I have said it before and will say it again...the greatest group of fans. Why can't there be an award for the best fans at the Grammys And I also want to thank the other writers the producers the team at syco modest their management and sony worldwide. And..... So one direction were the biggest selling artists in 2013. I know how much they put into this record from start to finish. Very proud. 1 Good luck my lil pal Sinitta tonight on The Jump. Will be watching. X I went to see the most incredible show tonight in New York. It's called Beautiful. It's the Carole King story. Amazing! Sorry I meant nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopppp Fingers crossed. It's ant and dec's night tonight. So well deserved. I really like you guys.

And I realised how many amazing songs got released this year. The tide has turned. I watched a wonderful life this week. I think it's the best Xmas movie of all time. And next week it's the X factor USA final. You have no idea what goes on behind the scenes! It's going to be a great final. Watch and see. Thank you to the entire production team who worked on X factor uk. And of course the judges and the talent. And to everyone who watched. Congratulations Sam. We'll deserved.

Hi Alice. Humbling. Someone today became my 9th million follower. Hello. Try and see the factor musical performance on the royal variety. It's very funny. I love this musical even though I am torn to shreds in it. bought my favorite car in the world this weekend so I am going to have to say goodbye to the Bugatti. Both are alpha males ,one has to go. Still not sure what a baby shower is. The Leona Xmas album is bloody fantastic. And the single one more sleep is one of the best Xmas singles in years. She is a total star. X factor USA May have delivered an artist who have huge potential after the show ends. Watch Wednesday on fox to see if you can guess. Il divo have delivered an amazing album. I don't say it enough. Great guys. Hard working and super talented. Jay Leno is genuinely one of the nicest person I have met in Hollywood My dogs are mad! A few lil catch ups since the weekend... We'll done kian. Very happy for you. Great performances from @littlemixoffic and @emblemthree last night. Congrats We are at a time when creativity has to be encouraged. It is one of the most important things we can do with our lives. And when you need it you have a block button! We all have times when we don't need negative energy influencing our moods. It is very cool we all have an outlet to speak and to be heard. It really is incredible. And most of the time it's all so positive. RT @YourFrenchie: @SimonCowell of course I agree! We should create a special day where it wouldn't be allowed to use phone or computer! But because I couldn't make nine million phone calls at the same time I like sending my lil tweets. And I like reading your replies. Do you agree if we sent less texts and emails and made more phone calls, or even (shock) spoke face to face more life would be easier. And just heard restless road have made it to number one on the iTunes country chart. So thank you once again. Alex and Sierra still number one at iTunes today. It really is a stunning version. And how brilliant is iTunes. I love them Hello. An interesting week! Very soon we have a lot of news to announce. So stay tuned. So sad to hear about Nelson Mandela. Rest in peace. And restless road number 2 on country iTunes. Thank you guys. Alex and Sierra number one on iTunes. Incredible. I think tonight's show was the best this year. It was all about the artists.

And huge congrats to one direction. Very very proud of you. Tonight. Fantastic. Restless road and Alex and Sierra amazing. That was a horrible ending to the show. We want our thanksgiving dinner http://t.co/lxJkR7vxMt And happy thanksgiving from diddly http://t.co/fEDXoKWqMc And happy thanksgiving from Squiddly. http://t.co/wtY8XVVclF A very happy thanksgiving to everyone. From me. Had a great time with @onedirection today at 1D Day http://t.co/CL0JIgm91U @outofsiggh hi And we have one direction on the show this Thursday. @lynne_caban thanks! I am interested across idol, britains got talent, X factorUk,XfactorUSA  and AGT,what have been you favorite panels over the years. Preparing for the seven hour one d marathon. Expect a lot of surprises! Did interviews with Conan today. Insane. And then Ellen. Funny. I really like both of them. Tomorrow is X factor USA. The theme is British Invasion. This is going to be a great show. Two contestants will leave this week. Gulp I had a great night at the launch of the new jaguar tonight. The car is stunning. You have to see it in real life. Being British has its perks! @JaguarUSA #GoodToBeBad #Ftypecoupe http://t.co/ijnKda5f0A For those of you watching \"another\" show you can help the Philippines Typhoon Appeal too. Text DEC to 70000 to donate \u00a35 to the @decappeal They desperately need our help. Huge thanks to @thexfactor team and to ITV for making this happen Tonight @thexfactor has backed The Sun's campaign for DEC Philippines Appeal &amp; we are donating profits from votes &amp; downloads to @decappeal I don't endorse dropping out of school but if for some reason you don't do as well as others that you can still do well in life. We encourage hard work and I believe everyone should have a chance to do well. I have a policy at my company that we judge people on their qualities not just their exam results Wow! I read the remarks today about a joke I made in an interview. I was lucky that after failing my exams I was given a chance to work hard I just heard a very sad story about a brave girl called Georgina Anderson. You can buy her song on iTunes. LOVE having @fifthharmony on the show Done Would anyone like Demi to sit next to me next week? @ecstasy_smiler @ddlovato @TheXFactorUSA  okaaaaaay. I get it. Insane show but I loved it. Alex &amp; Sierra best they've sung so far Carlos boring, Restless Road nervous but great. So much pressure on the contestants right now. Zombie dogs rule http://t.co/jST0eBSZFb I just can't sleep. Squiddly. http://t.co/Hbl5FjU4mY @louissrsly I can't say. But this person was incredibly rude. My favorite question is who is the worst well known person you have met and why. I have heard some horror stories. James album this week. It's reeeeealy good. And little mix with their stunning new single. Very proud of both artists. My 900th tweet. Thank you for reading my ramblings. You make my life and work fun. And thanks for all of your feedback. X Simon just told me about the mistake on the show tonight. http://t.co/ENNJ7laiZy I think Simons groups are amazing. Love Squiddly. http://t.co/yKY5pOYtR1 Please vote for Simons groups tomorrow. Love diddly. http://t.co/usYUTulY1O And for a couple of contestants they must be thanking their lucky stars they get to sing another song tomorrow. I also should of course mentioned little mix tonight as a girl group having huge success. It's that live tv curse again. It's happened once before. It's live tv. You have to deal with it, tough for the contestants though. But you have to dig deep and deliver. Now they will understand what pressure means. Mistakes happen. But now I have 24 hours to prepare my groups for tomorrow night. Let's hope they all deliver. There was an issue so everyone has to sing their save me song live tomorrow and America will vote on that performance A lot of you noticed there were some problems with the voting numbers at the end of the show tonight...you were right! And how did tamera get in the bottom two on the uk show. She is a potential star. Squiddly wants an ice cream http://t.co/J6VqJlndYU Very excited for X factor tomorrow. And we have a big surprise. Squiddly has gone mad http://t.co/mEzM5jdaaS Squiddly and diddly had a long day http://t.co/bbXtrCX7BE Happiness is 2 puppies asleep. http://t.co/lgefFjGJ02 I have just been sent this from Holland's Got Talent @hgt_nl, what a total star!! http://t.co/QdWNKcQiGJ One big fat ooops I think the story of my life is the best one d video yet. And I love the record. So sad to hear Lou reed has passed away. A legend. Worked with my groups today ready for Tuesdays show. I have the winner this year. I would have kept miss dynamix. I don't get that decision. @YanizMammi @thexfactoraust yes. Love the show @Clarinha_J yes. Tuesday this week then Wednesdays and Thursdays. @IWantLoveOf1D love it Rambling a bit tonight. But calmly thinking good energy is a better feeling than hatred to others . The latter will eventually bite you. And like I say to my staff and artists never forget who makes everything possible...the people who watch our shows. So I feel proud of my team this week. The music side and the TV company. And I am excited for the artists competing. On the uk X factor show I see three acts who will go on to sell records. A couple more if they dig deep can do the same. On Tuesday X factor USA returns. The first live show. We have some very special talent. And they all want to win. The stakes just got higher You realise without great people you have nothing. I spent three days this week with my uk and us tv teams. Thirty people. The youngest 18. They are doing amazing work. So excited that today the brilliant @OneChanceMovie is out in the cinemas. Check out the trailer http://t.co/stQpzO4BZe Today I love my job. The fifth harmony ep is out this week. Currently number 2 on the album chart. Lets hope it makes number one. Thank you.\n\n. Really excited about @JamesArthur23's new single, it deserves to be a number 1 record http://t.co/owxYWhi7Ky Sorry I couldn't be at the Paul Potts premiere. The film is fantastic. I have seen it twice now. James corden is a total star. I am setting up a squiddly diddly twitter account. It was Lauren my girlfriend who chose the outfits. Everyone is saying different Laurens. Lauren chose their outfits @CrackiNiall of course Squiddly is the girl and diddly is the boy #squiddlyanddiddly Introducing squiddly and diddly http://t.co/AVUTDR1WeK Tomorrow night it all gets sorted. I think you will enjoy the show. Thanks for all your comments. Both the bad and the good. During one performance tonight one of my new puppies ran out of my bedroom and wouldn't come back until I turned the sound off. Reading your comments tonight made me realise we should do this. It seems like the fairest thing to do. I will do my best to make it happen. And you will choose the person or group you want as your wild card pick. If we did this. You guys not us would make the decision. Will keep you posted. I would love it to happen. Should we have a wild card. Let the public pick. What do you think? Pauline's top 4 would not have been my top 4 You never let great talent go. RT @IHeart__Niall: WHY IS @SimonCowell GETTING SO MUCH ATTRACTIVE AS THE SHOW CONTINUES. Opposite of oops Oops Google her name and mine. And I had a great birthday yesterday. Thanks again for all of your tweets. I think sinead o'connor would be a real fun guest judge on X factor. She loves the show and everything I do. Let me know sinead. Verrrrrrrrrry funnnnnny @FifthHarmony. @iamjavis1D yes @Deva5SOS happy birthday and get well soon. @cvddlemecashton my favourite present was my two new dogs. @mariahkhan123 happy birthday too. Hello. Thank you for all my birthday messages. Time for bed. Sleep well. Thank you for all your comments and thoughts. @L_Tomlmlinsonx  very good. Thank you for asking. @Suli22 yes @miamalik55 11 @TomlinShine_ buy a dog as well @lovatostyless @ddlovato I tHink she is one of the most genuine person I have ever met. And for anyone thinking of buying a dog. Do it. They bring so much happiness into your life. @indiniam life and thoughts. Try it. @mckendrykieran9 it was great. It was for my syco team in America. And yes even the negative ones. My dad taught me it is smarter to listen rather than talk. And that's why I love twitter. So any ideas and thoughts are always welcome. But hard work and focus gives you a chance to turn a corner. And that's how I am feeling right now. In life you can obsess on other people's failures or focus on your own mistakes and work hard to make sure you don't repeat them. Excited to reveal some news in the next few weeks. Am feeling very positive right now. It's been hard work but nothing should be too easy. I have a feeling his new album will be a classic. I met with Labrinth a few weeks ago. I really believe this guy is a genius. And seriously one of the nicest person I have met. And this week I get to hear the new il divo album. And Susan Boyle back on form. Her new album has a duet with elvis. It's a special moment. Sending all of these tweets in one go because everything arrived this week. Sorry if it feels like one big plug but I am really happy. Oops I meant Leona Lewis. The new Leonard Lewis Xmas album is fantastic. On one track she is the best I have ever heard her sing. Love the new little mix single. James Arthur first single is a smash. This guy can really sing. Just signed off on the new emblem3 video for 3000 miles. It's great Have just chosen the next fifth harmony single. Can you guess what it is? Hi. The new one d video is amazing. @mattmccloat really?!!! @ModsOfDiversity thank you. @mavisann38 hi. They are yorkies. Brother and sister. Four months old. Thank you for all of your ideas for my new dogs. They are a brother and sister. And I have to say totally adorable. Two new arrivals ...... Any suggestions for names? http://t.co/gcDPgWOANh Fifty people coming to my house tonight for dinner. Time to have a bath. Love my new car. It's a caterham. It is the maddest car I have ever driven. X factor starting on the west coast at eight.Very different to what we have done before. Hello. Reading all your comments. Thank you. #AskMeToDance may be this year's hit after all\u2026 What should my rapper name be? Why buy the cow? I honestly thought he was going to eat @KellyRowland Wish I had been there for tims audition I wasn't about to cry. I've never heard that version of Titanium before, and I hope I never will again. Nothing should be easy. Don't blame others. Dig deep and always try your best. Life is fun when it tests you. And never ever blame others. Loyalty is still alive in the music industry. Expect a release this week and some other news. It's X factor time Currently flying back to. Do I watch batman or seabiscuit? And a huge thank you to everyone who watched it. Congrats kenichi on winning got talent. And congrats and thanks to the team that made it. And of course our four judges. I think Jeff could be a real contender this year\u2026I'm very glad he came back I actually missed Danie's audition that day, I was very very surprised how good she was when I watched it back. I think Chloe was actually in love with me. And by the way, that picture Demi tweeted was not me. She's losing her mind. And here is Vincent\u2026and his security!!! I really like these guys I think Josh is a little star in the making Make sure you tune in to @TheXFactorUSA tonight &amp; tomorrow at 8pm.

Verrrryyyy good. I was lucky to meet David once. I asked him for one bit of advice. He told me always know when to leave the fair. Great advice. Watching Inventing David Geffen on Apple TV. For anyone who wants to see what it takes to succeed. Watch this movie. A genius. Congrats Andy. Had a bet you would win. Amazing result. Congrats Andy. Had a bet Missed the fifth harmony girls. They are sounding amazing. Me and My Girls @FifthHarmony http://t.co/sNHnKfezrX Big day for @Xfactor_RTL tomorrow. The grand finale. Best of luck @harismusic95, @adriaanpersons &amp; @bbraveofficial And when I land in la straight to the dentists. Gulp Currently flying over Arizona. Drinking a delicious cup of tea. Denver was great. Auditions...fantastic. Strange. Weird. But overall we had a great time and found some potential stars. Gabz. Lighters. If you haven't heard this it is fantastic! @LewisCorreia1 you don't. Others do. Be happy. X @benwinston they had a great director. That goes without saying. And I didn't snub Cheryl's party. I just couldn't go because of my filming dates. We are close friends again and I adore her. If you haven't heard Chloe by emblem3. You should. It's slooooowly rising the charts. The more I hear it the more I like it. Some things are more important than the music\"business\" or the tv \"business\". And today I learnt that. Someone I work closely with today taught me the importance of friendship, trust and loyalty. This person is a very special person. The rough cut of the fifth harmony video came in today for miss movin on. I love it. Denver auditions started today. Some great. Some truly awful. Two more days to go. Two people today were outstanding. Hi. A lot has happened in two days... The new one d video for best song ever is their best video ever, these boys are very very smart. Just arrived in Denver. No sign of the other girls. Good luck to the finalists of @xfactornz! Have a fantastic night @WPatuwai @moorhousemusic @jackiesian @Gap5_official @CassHenderson14 Had a very nice evening at my friend Carl's birthday last night. Elton John performed. He sounded amazing. My thoughts are with you Demi. X Just did an interview with @kilmeade @FoxandFriends Very interesting! Goes out Monday between 6 &amp; 9 ET. No shirts! Congrats on @KELLYROWLAND's album out now - I've heard it and it's amazing Happy Birthday @PaulaAbdul. Lots of love, miss you, Simon @pottypony hi hope you are feeling better. Simon @KelseyMcCauleyy for jet lag? Last week. London. New Orleans. Los Angeles. New York. Long Island. Then New York. London. Denver Los Angeles. What is a good jet lag cure? Some of the auditions in New Orleans were just great. Some were horrendous. But we had a great time. Long Island this week. Starts Wednesday. Can't wait. Happy 50th @paurubio, lots of love, Simon A weird five days. Started with eggs on bgt. Flew to New Orleans. Filmed auditions and on the second day a guy performed in a chicken suit. I watched an early cut of the one direction film tonight on the plane back to Los Angeles. This is going to be a great movie. And I love it. A very different show this year. I'd does feel time for a change. I thought X factor would be fun this year with me and three girls on the panel. Be careful what you wish for! It's different! Two days in New Orleans. Started slow and then the talent showed up. A great city with great people. Demi. Stopppppppppppppppppp please with the horrific pictures. They are giving me nightmares. Nigel lythgoe and kenny Warwick leaving idol? We started off together. A few ok times and lot of great times. Thank you for everything. Someone is going to be happy sitting next to me today. Ready for the auditions to start in New Orleans? @johnprescott. That was funny. I don't think eggs should be allowed on talent shows. Discuss? Bloody hell! Just watched the Adam and Richard performance back. They didn't miss a note. I loved the show tonight. Great winners and a future star the runner up. Thanks to everyone who has watched the show. I really don't like eggs. The @EmblemThree  album (which is fantastic!) is coming out in America soon. Click here to preorder it http://t.co/C48vVuVvXN. Best, Simon I drove one of the best cars in the world this week. It's a super light caterham 7. Unbelievable. Have ordered one for America. @SallyFinestone I hate eggs Ha ha. Meant going home. And if I am very lucky butterscotch angel delight for pudding. Gong home to eat fish and chips,a gherkin and bread and butter. Very happy. Miss moving on. And it is fantastic! Very funny night with Louis Walsh last night. Lou lous is my favourite restaurant now. And the first fifth harmony single is......... At rehearsals. Tomorrows final is going to be fantastic. Sorry. That was a misspell Brittantella @directiovatic28 a million percent yes Loved Americas got talent last night. Panel great and nick a total star. Congratulations little mix. Very proud of you. X Time for bed. Goodnight. @waltzer_boy I don't have a twitter guy or twitter girl. This is Simon. @harmonugger yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssswsssssss Dear fifth harmony. Please. Announce. The. Single. Release. Date. And. The. Name. Of. The Song. This. Week. Thank you. Simon. X Wild card has been chosen for next weeks bgt final. I think it will be a popular choice. David chose a dog act. He is a bit tired. Sorry Katherine. X I have to admit Demi is a fantastic singer. It was a great week. Looking forward to next Saturday. Thanks to everyone who watched.

A total superstar. I can't get gabz song the one out of my head. Loving britains got talent this year. Congrats to jack and gabz tonight. Good night everyone. I did think Lewis was very cool this week no excuses. Took it on the chin. Class. @NootWood yes. Agreed. And then worst of all the noise Sebastian Vettel makes when he wins. I still think it's the greatest sport in the world. Have you noticed a lot of whining from the drivers this year. He is too close. He wouldn't let me overtake him. He overtook me. Etc. Loved the Monaco Grand Prix this weekend. A couple of things are a bit annoying I really do like working on bgt. It is a little crazy and then you sometimes find these gems. Tonight had its moments! Success doesn't create a monster.It enables them to become a monster. Show starts in half an hour.

Well most of them. @MimisLilLambUK I was thinking that maybe I could work to find the right artist to represent us. If they would let me. Back in London now.

Are you? http://t.co/NxLJYnuNR3 Lee rigby. A true hero. My thoughts are with your family. Stuck on an island. Flooded in. Can't get to the venue. Oh my god. Just read about Oklahoma. My thoughts and prayers to everyone affected. On my way to charleston watching the first episode of Americas got talent. It's spectacular. Looking forward to meeting you - Simon Hi Auditions start earlier now -on Tues May 21.If you want to come &amp; see what happens, here's the link for tickets http://t.co/gQUWpYlOJz @traluog_ yes I do. Who was terrible by the way. If you are an animal reading this please rehearse for next years britains got talent now. A painting donkey was the best we got this year. Although I hear it is fun to drive the new f type jag looks ugly to me. Why didn't they just revise the e type. The most beautiful car ever. How amazing is the daft punk single. Hi randy and Paula. Thank you for your tweets. Goodnight everyone. X Randy leaving idol made me remember that Paula randy me and Ryan had the best time. I miss them. Would like to hear who you think are as well. And of course one direction. Who made it happen through sheer determination. And pink. And for anyone looking for advice on who too look to as an inspiration when you are auditioning for one of our shows. One name. Beyonce. And I spent an hour with a very smart guy this week. It is the best feeling when you can listen rather than talk. I learnt something very important this week in relation to my work. Loyalty. It will always pay you back. We start x factor auditions in charleston on Tuesday. The new panel will be announced Monday. This is going to be an interesting show! And the same with emblem 3. Nearly finished the fifth harmony album. This is a great record Have spent a lot of time on the one direction movie. It's going to be fantastic. You really get to know the guys. So proud of them. Angelina is a very special lady. And I believe she will save a lot of people's lives by going public. So many things to talk about. The weirdo who locked up those girls. Don't send him to prison lock him in a basement like he did to the girls My apologies for disappearing. Have been focusing on work. It's time for bed. A long week ahead. Goodnight everyone. @punchstagram I love popcorn. I wish I had invented twitter. And Facebook. And you tube. @iGomezSmile ? @ibangrauhl yes. A lot. Two new judges. Announcing soon. Tens of thousands showing up to audition. And some changes. I have a good feeling. @materialgirl83 yes. That is my plan. @chersmjles very good thank you. @chrisluketwomey you are probably right. I might start one. I believe Susan Boyle had appeared on another tv show years ago. Nothing happened. Bgt gave her another go. Is that wrong? I am not whining. Simply wanted to explain there is no hush hush plot. I just think everyone deserves a second chance. The reason we always let the public vote is they can decide who they want to win. Would it be right to say to someone who has appeared on a show before you can't audition? Everyone who auditions is either looking for a break or a second chance We try and have a no rules policy on the show We have had some stick regarding so called established stars appearing on bgt this year @andy_drew_is yes! It's delicious. I have cut down smoking. A lot. Using electric cigarettes to help. Are they bad for you? Iris is currently number five on iTunes after last nights show. Credit to the guy who sang it. Thank you once again for everyone who tuned into britains got talent. I love making this show. Have just seen an early cut on the Paul Potts movie. It's fantastic. And James corden a total star. The loveable rogues single is out this week. A great record. On my way out. Goodnight everyone. I love the panel on bgt even though David is realllllly annoying at times. And we have the best presenters in the world. Ant and dec. And talking of girl groups the fith harmony album sounds fantastic. I haven't said enough about little mix. Great girls. If you don't live in the uk check them out. Great girls. @acdavies62 I totally agree @shoeshine65 the voice But to call her a fake is unfair. I was there. She was terrified. And now I understand why. Alice on bgt. She simply lost her confidence after that reaction and she did sound better on bgt Alice fredenham on the voice tonight. Confident and hopeful. Nobody turned round. I went to Manchester to see one d perform. What a great night. Spending some time with the boys made me realise how little they have changed RT @welshjaci: Debating which tattoo to get - @simoncowell or @judgealexferrer http://t.co/0QlwVXeEtE - and follow my two favourite boys! Watching the news. Horrendous. Please god no more bombs. Stay safe America. Very excited that @emblemthree's new single \"Chloe\" is out today. Here is the link to get it from iTunes http://t.co/WHpm6PF44F #E3Chloe @xxingelouisa hello @21sarita hello @EilidhMarieRoss me too A big thank you to all of you who watched bgt last night. It is always much appreciated. Good night. Sleep well. Finished my calls to America. Am feeling very positive about my shows and artists this year. For whatever reason I feel more focused. I know this all sounds a bit deep but certain days have an impact on you. And my big thought for 2013 is try and make the second half of your life better than the first half. My dad once told me everyone around you or other people have an invisible sign around their head. It says make me feel important. And sometimes it's the quiet ones around you who you sometimes take for granted are watching your back. I saw it happen today. No matter how strong you think you are we all need the support of loyal people around us who genuinely care for you. If you haven't heard of Katie piper check out her story. An incredible person. And later still at an event felt happy that so many people I have worked with for years are still great friends. Today was a day I realised how many talented people work with me. And later how inspirational some people are. And now it's time for a thirty minute nap before I go out. Going to support my buddy Katie piper tonight. She has her second fund raising ball. She is an inspiration. And I think I am getting the flu. Feeling sorry for myself. Saw a preview of Jodie marsh bullied. You should try and see this. Channel 5 tonight at 11pm Saw an incredible movie last night called untouchable. It's French with subtitles. One of my favourite films Just got back from britains got talent launch. Very good. @nouiscakessss hi @louieharsant two weeks time @CinemaMag and the same to you. And congrats boys in beating that other singing show in the ratings. I watched the first episode of britains got talent last night. Amazing. I think you are going to really like it. Congrats ant and dec on your number one. Amazing. Had a lot of fun on the show last night. On my way to do ant and decs show. It's going to be a lot of fun And I won an award for favourite villain. I think that's a compliment so thank you for voting. If you haven't seen a movie called flight you should. It's an incredible film. Saw more of the one direction movie which Morgan spurlock has directed. Very very good. Just watched the little mix video with missy Elliot. It is sensational. Had a great week in la. something really exciting happened. Will announce soon I hope. Currently on my way back to London. Ate a toffee crisp for dinner. 10 mins till You Generation launch with 1D live stream! Fancy being my new presenter? #TYGlaunch! http://t.co/zXBH1FoRRK Touch down @honeylove300 happy birthday I love flying over Los Angeles at night. Always looks stunning Tea on the plane was also very delicious. Scones. Raspberry jam and cucumber sandwiches. Just about to land in la. @claireybearb yes I write my own tweets Currently at 35000 feet on my way to la. dinner is pasta and bean soup from a restaurant called scalinis which is beyond delicious. On a twelve hour flight tomorrow so it's time to follow some new friends. I was a little deep tonight but it was one of those nights you realise you have a lot to be thankful for. That's about it for now. I hope to announce something very close to me that I have been working on soon. And for everyone who has bothered to follow me. Thank you. I have learnt a lot from you guys. What I have realised is there will be bumps in your life but the fun is fixing them. If it was always easy life would be boring. Sorry to cram all this in. Have read some strange things about me recently. I am happy. Healthy. And enjoying life. Hope you are too. And with everything I have been working on it made me realise that your friends and family are still the most important things in your life. Have just finished the britains got talent auditions. We still have a lot of talent in this country. And still on movies the Paul Potts movie from what I have seen is brilliant. Seen some early footage on the one d movie. Very very exciting. Please check out you generation this week. It's worth it. On syco uk we are working hard on James and Ella. I have a very good feeling about these two. Tates album is finished. Did some radio with him last week. He is the most genuine guy. The first emblem 3 single arrived a week ago. It is fantastic. And fifth harmony are going from strength to strength. Single soon. One direction continue to amaze me. Hard workers but still the nicest guys you could hope to work with. There will be a lot of changes on X factor uk and USA. But good changes. I feel excited for both shows this year. Just finished my calls to la. I wanted to apologise about not tweeting recently. I have been focusing a lot on work. I hope you liked the comic relief sketch. Written by the very weird David Walliams.

Am on my way to see the workshop of X factor the musical. Have been filming britains got talent this week. Some great auditions. And some of the worst I have seen including a dancing raccoon. It's about a singer called Rodriquez. He is seriously good. Sorry I meant searching for sugar man Watching looking for sugar man. What a great movie. And his music is incredible. Hello. To all the harmonisers. Thank you for all the support. Happy to confirm we have signed fifth harmony. Ok. I heard you. Maybe it's time for a large dose of girl power... You know I like to get a little feedback from time to time and I trust your opinions. I see a lot of support for fifth harmony. Do you think we should sign the girls? I have missed you all. @Daniellew104433 happy birthday Not really steal. Borrow someone's tape but don't give it back. And I still want my penguin And loads of exciting news to follow.

I am really going to need your support more than ever this week. And if I get it I will always be nice to puppies. Spent all day at rehearsals. One song is the Pepsi choice the second unplugged. Some amazing performances. We have some real talent. Looking forward to the uk final next week. It's all in your hands now. The Sunday show is going to be incredible. I met Linda perry  today who is one of the greatest songwriters. Absolutely loved her! @Kitty_420 hello @TogetherXLove watch this space! @sn_balqis noted @Lindseyoak you are right. The Australian x factor was fantastic this year. I have already congratulated them. And I can again. @onedirection. I hear the concert tonight was fantastic. Congrats guys. You have come a long way. I can't believe @britneyspears called me senile...I've forgotten what I was going to say back. @onedirection Best of luck guys for Madison Square Garden hope it's a fantastic night for you. Happy Birthday @britneyspears you look great for 40 lots of love Simon Goodnight everyone. If you like Xmas movies watch Arthur Christmas. I loved it. I absolutely love ho hey by the lumineers. @Lindseyoak I agree. Loved your show this year. It was tough tonight on the sing off. Both did well. I thought in the studio diamond was better. I hope the exposure vino got will help him I do think the us and uk finals are going to be close and that makes it more exciting. Especially if a group wins the us show! On the uk show I do have a favourite but its your vote that determines the winner. Whoever wins will get the backing of Sony. I want to personally thank everyone who voted for my groups this week. I really do think both have improved. It's much appreciated. Looking forward to seeing @aliciakeys and @joshkrajcik on the show tonight. #joshisback I need your help tonight guys. I thought @FifthHarmony and @EmblemThree were amazing. Please vote!!! Watching mr poppers penguins again. I love this film. I really do want a pet penguin. @LucyLBax sorry. I meant happy birthday @LucyLBax happy birthdat Just realised I am following 666 people. That is a little scary Both emblem 3 and 5th harmony very good in rehearsals today. I am happy. @ICONicTayler312 thank you Who is mr. T? Thank you for the replies. I was curious because it was mentioned in a few messages. Who is mr x? Hello. Thank you for your emblem 3 and fifth harmony song suggestions. You will see what I have chosen for the Pepsi challenge next week. Good night. Sleep well. @TogetherXLove I agree I went to a thanksgiving party and someone told me to listen rather than talk. You have two ears and one mouth. Very good advice @niamissocool every day Why I am angry about weirdo gore is a ton of people have got shot this year and people.like weirdo gore encourage this. I read Martin gore wants to shoot  me. He was is in depeche mode. Do you realise how weird and stupid that makes you. Go and watch the news. Hi Olly Murs. Congratulations on your number one single today. You are a true star and a great guy. Proof success doesn't change you. Time for bed. One piece of advice...cut all of the negative people out of your life and suddenly life gets better. I just realised we only have four more shows left here. It's gone so quick. This is one of those nights when I have to talk to London from la. that's why at five am I am sending out tweets. Would love you to suggest some song ideas for emblem 3 and 5th harmony. I have to get them into the finals. I Watched a film tonight called Arthur Christmas. Loved it. And actually proves Santa Claus is real! Cher was fantastic on X factor this week. A brat. But adorable. To everyone voting in the uk tonight. Please vote for who you believe could be a star next year. It's in your hands. The final in America could be our closest yet. There may be more than two acts in the final. And you never know what could happen. The final here in America could be our closest yet. There may be more Re X factor uk. Yes to someone who just guessed it. I was sad to lose Beatrice. But I felt the pressure on her was too much. But I have a feeling she will have a big future. Very interesting end coming up for X factor in the uk. I think the final is going to be very interesting! I have my own favourite. Very sad to hear about larry hagman. He was the best tv baddie and from people who met him all said he was a great guy. He will be missed. Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Thought @emblemthree were amazing,  @LA_Reid is in a bad mood! And Diamond White was sensational. @Harry_Styles cheers Harry. RT @Harry_Styles: @SimonCowell cheers boss .x Ella! Gone??? Unbelievable. Massive congrats to the one d boys for having the number one single and album in the uk. Could not be happier for you. @Janina yes you. X @Janina hello trouble. Simon. X Hi. This is to Susan Boyle.

I really miss not being on the show The theme next week is divas, I expect brilliance from everyone, one d proved tonight how this show can change your life. Use it. I was wrong about Paige. She is a potential star I think we are heading for an interesting competition. It's youth versus experience. All too play for still but a massive wake up call. If there is one thing I learned if you like your act you have to vote What the hell happened with the results tonight! One direction were amazing on X factor tonight. Very proud of the boys. For the first time we are going to reveal the order of the contestants from 13-1.. so we're going to find out who WON last night.

Did I look stupid in that tiara? Good luck with your album this week Jonathan and Charlotte. You both sound amazing on it. @joncharofficial @GotTalent The healer brings in good energy.

RT @BieberSwagConda Follow @SimonCowell he's Uncle Simon! Sitting in rehearsals, listening to @ItsMelanieAmaro . She's going to blow the roof off on Wednesday! @LA_Reid looking very grumpy. Actually @LA_Reid this is a SINGING competition. So please vote @ItsMelanieAmaro Congrats to Little Mix & congrats to Military Wives . It's a great cause & a worthy Christmas No.1 Thank you America! I am very very nervous. Melanie incredible! Please don't let what happened to Rachel happen to her. @ItsMelanieAmaro @TheXFactorUSA That was appalling Marcus. You deserve better than that! Round 1- Melanie and Josh Marcus is going to need a second song! @TheXFactorUSA #facethemusic Everyone is laughing at my new car. But I love it and it glows in the dark! http://t.co/PIIrSXN3 Just taped @jimmykimmel - Ouch! He's turned into me. Very uncomfortable, but brilliant! About to do @jimmykimmel with @LA_Reid , @NicoleScherzy & @PaulaAbdul . Should be fun, can't wait! I was really hoping a group would win this year. @OfficialTulisa has done a great job. These girls could be stars. Congratulations to @LIttleMixOffic . And Paula as you can see, groups can win this show! ...and I think @officialtulisa should be a permanent 5th member! Thought @TheXFactor UK looked amazing. I think a group may win for the first time ever. Rachel went out on a high tonight. Thanks to everyone who voted for her. @iamrachelcrow @TheXFactorUSA Help!! I'm hoping everything works out well tonight, but I have a weird feeling. I know he's not my contestant, but Chris was incredible! Rachel back on form. As I said on the show, do not let that girl end up in the piranha tank! Melanie sounded amazing in the studio. One of my favourite performances from her. Very productive feedback from @PaulaAbdul ! It's going to be an interesting night. We had to change all of their second songs, so nerves are a little fraught! @TheXFactorUSA And on the subject of movies, why haven't they made Anchorman 2? It's the funniest film I have ever seen. I just watched a movie called 'Closer To The Edge'. It is incredible! Having heard the news of Susan Boyle's Grammy nomination, I've just heard @leonalewismusic has one too. Congratulations! Good & bad news tonight. I'm very upset for Drew-still think she's a star. Congrats to Susan for her Grammy nomination,I'm thrilled for her. Not happy! But thank you to everyone who has supported @drewryniewicz I'm terrified. @TheXFactorUSA I am excited but nervous about tonight.I don't know why. @TheXFactorUSA Just blown away. That was a massive surprise! I knew something was going on, but I didn't expect that. I think we are in for a lot of surprises tonight. The producers look very suspicious. I am going to try and tweet more often, and a quick message to the Il Divo  boys: congrats, the album is outstanding. Why would you want anyone else? RT @AmberL_ If I had a famous dinner party I think @SimonCowell would be top on list followed by @antanddec I agree RT@Sanaa_xoX you should tweet more often Simon! If you don't know about the charity @Tog4ShortLives it is run by amazing people. You're all very generous. @TheXFactor Heard earlier on today @TheXFactor UK charity single looks like it\u2019s going to be No.1. A massive thank you to everyone who supported this. Just finished rehearsals, they are all terrified this week. I think we could be in for a shock tomorrow. Had to escape to my trailer. Happy Thanksgiving. I am very thankful for the support and fun I have had in the past ten years. Thank you America. I'm absolutely thrilled. #XFactor Bloody hell! It's the first night I have started to feel really anxious. @LA_Reid is not talking to me. @TheXFactorUSA Two are going to go home. My girls need all the support they can get. Thank you. I am now seriously annoyed, but I trust the public are going to support Drew's talent. . @LA_Reid just came outside to ask who is trending now, he sounds insecure.  #ohsnap Now starting to feel the pressure because two people are going home tomorrow. And by the way, what is Nicole wearing? I think she still thinks it's Halloween. #ohsnap One down. Brilliant start. Can't understand a word Paula is saying-probably a good thing. #ohsnap This is my favourite fan site. @PiersMorgan there are quite a few. RT @Cowell_Online We are the BEST fan page for news,photos & videos! Two of the other contestants have asked me to choose their songs, but I can't! @TheXFactorUSA . @drewryniewicz is back on form. She chose the song, and she's going to nail it! . @ItsMelanieAmaro didn\u2019t like the song first of all, now she does! It's going to be a big surprise and a big moment. . @iamrachelcrow Very clever choice of song this week, big production. I love it! I am absolutely blown away by @RebeccaFMusic her album, her performance. Congratulations! I went to the car show yesterday and I might buy a Smart car with gull wings and very dark tinted windows! RT @maudeapatow: I just met @SimonCowell at the X Factor. How do you sum up such an important moment in one small tweet? @hellogiggles h ... Hello. Have you fainted yet? Simon x RT @CreoleTexan I'm tweeting @SimonCowell as if he's gonna tweet back but i'd prob faint if he replies . @piersmorgan Why are you still being so ridiculously competitive? You should have realised by now it's quality, not quantity. Thank you for the Thanksgiving invitations. Could I have some menus sent before I decide? I've just realised it's Thanksgiving this week and I haven't been invited to anyone's house. I feel like a dog without a home I've just been told I can tweet when its not a show day! Met with Astro and his father today and @LA_Reid. Everything is much calmer now and the good news is he's back on the show next week I agree with Astro's message: it's 'time to relax & reflect' I very nearly changed my mind. Thank you America. That was horrendous, but I'm glad for my girls. How the hell did that happen? After the show today, the judges and contestants are going to be at the Grove in LA. Looking forward to meeting you all there! @piersmorgan look up the word deluded in your dictionary I love being on twitter. Thank you for allowing me to beat the other 3 in the popularity poll. Paula looked like she'd sucked on a lemon! Drew was amazing. The girls @PaulaAbdul and @NicoleScherzy are threatened by her. Melanie-incredible but Josh just stole the show. Leroy-boring, Rachel-amazing, @la_reid is mad That's not rock! More news to follow, got some surprises in store. Thank you. #iamsimon It's official, I know it's taken a while. It's really me!
