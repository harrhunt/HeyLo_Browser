Dig deep, stay strong, and do it for yourself! You should always recognize how important you are to YOU. Change bad habits, be a good person, find something positive to focus on and don\u2019t lose hope. You will make it out with a genuine smile on your face Mental health is a very serious issue.  When you feel like you\u2019re at your lowest it may seem like there\u2019s no point of life, or that you don\u2019t matter, none of which is actually true. It may take a lot of time to escape those awful feelings and thoughts but you are strong enough - Breaks my heart to see Pete Davidson feeling like this :( Hold on and stay tough man, the reason may not seem clear right now but life will come around for you.

I am sorry if anyone was upset. \u2665\ufe0f I\u2019m here to spread love and positivity. It seems as if people want to twist my words to make me seem like a bad person nowadays. I know who I am and that is the accepting person that I was raised to be. It\u2019s unfair that people try to twist situations and take that away from me.- Just did something new \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udd7a Wow I really thought today was Saturday I was walking around universal tonight and I saw a girl wearing me and E\u2019s merch but she didn\u2019t see me yet.

After doing the same thing every week for 3 years you start to question yourself a lot. By no means do we want to stop making videos every week we just need some change in our lives. We\u2019re feeling really reinspired now and the vibe in the air is so much better. It\u2019s funny how well you guys know us. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments on our recent video saying that our videos seem too forced and that we\u2019re uninterested in the stuff we do now. Me and e were feeling kind of stuck creatively for a while but a lot has changed in the past week.

People have lost loved ones, idols, hero\u2019s, fans to suicide. Filming a video and mocking a victim is not raising suicide awareness. Laughing at the body of a poor depressed soul. I can\u2019t believe the disrespect of the victim, their family, and your YOUNG fans. I\u2019m not gonna stay silent I\u2019m gonna stand up for what\u2019s right right now My # 1 goal for 2018 is to start having more fun on social media again.
