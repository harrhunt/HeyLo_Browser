We designed and we planned. I wanted to be fully hands on, and work without any limitations. Everyone on the team believed in me and for the first time, I truly believed in myself. Here I was, a spokeswoman for women, telling them to never give up and believe in themselves when no one else does. I needed to take a moment to look in the mirror and encourage myself and invest in myself for once. One day, I was encouraging my best friend to invest in herself and pursue a dream of hers. A light bulb went off when I realized I needed to take my own advice. 15 years of false starts and people telling me \u201cno\u201d was frustrating, but also made me more determined. If you know anything about me, you know that when someone tells me \u201cno,\u201d it only makes me work harder. Every time I would go into a department store to present a collection it would always end up with - we love it but we are going to pass... I tried many times to align with people who could help me get things off the ground while I played tennis worked with designers and sketched my ideas. I got so many no\u2019s from potential partners, people I admired and respected. That was 2001. I had a vision to create a fashion line unrelated to tennis, but soon realized the complexities of manufacturing and running a business was more than my schedule would allow, as I focused on winning Grand Slams. They say life is about timing. I learned this lesson at age 18, when I chose to play a light tennis schedule because I wanted to go to fashion school. Some criticized my decision, but I knew I had two loves--tennis and fashion--and had to find a way to make them coexist. RT @ShopSerena: Strong. Sexy. Sophisticated.\n\nBe the first to rep Serena tomorrow! \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udfff#BeSeenBeHeard\n\nhttps://t.co/oR9OUKEWG9 https:\u2026 Catsuit anyone?
