Also a tour manager and business manager as things grow is important. All of these positions will start off with your cousins/friends and they\u2019ll either grow with your business or you\u2019ll find others to fit in those roles. @CharlieCurtisB @1AMRadio @sleepxtite When u aren\u2019t making money, no one working around u will be either. But as you aquire hometown gigs and reinvest that in cheap merch your margins will start to grow, and if your a good person you\u2019ll start paying more to thise around you. @TheOnlyJarad @1AMRadio Are u saying that someones not your manager unless youve signed a deal? @_THATKIDWAVY_ Lol my 2 week exclusive?

But its not the door to success by any means @vevosuave @ChiQigi @1AMRadio Brent isn\u2019t wrong at all, a publishing company will pitch your songs for syncs and put advance money in your pocket.
