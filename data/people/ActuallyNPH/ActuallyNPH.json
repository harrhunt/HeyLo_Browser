I\u2019d say I was bummed, but Catherine O\u2019Hara told me: losing an Emmy to \u2018When You Wish Upon A Pickle\u2019 is in many ways, a funnier way to end the story. I like that. #befitting  #countolaf @netflix @TheEmmys @zombah76 @halfpricebooks I\u2019ll DM you an address - if you mail it back unopened, I\u2019ll send you something utterly awesome. Does the new iPhone 11 Pro come with drool protection..? #want #need @Apple Sending thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by the tragic events of 18 years ago. New York is my home, and its diverse residents are a shining example of strength and resilience. #NeverForget911 This is fantastic! Thanks for choosing my book, I\u2019m super honored. Hope you enjoy the sequel, and number 3 comes out in a matter of weeks! Yay, Book Clubs! https://t.co/igmNttgKgS Can\u2019t believe that my THIRD Magic Misfits book comes out next month. It\u2019s a proper series, yo..! Doing a bit of a book tour - if you\u2019re able to come, please say hi. I\u2019m super proud of the world that I\u2019ve created. #MagicMisfits https://t.co/Xjcxa0oNGW Ending #AIDS, #TB and #malaria is within reach, but not yet fully in our grasp.

Thanks again for having me, @EscThisPodcast https://t.co/uRxhXi2Abh I\u2019m the guest on an awesome audio escape room podcast! Still reading this? Awesome.

Have a great time today, and try to use some common sense. https://t.co/wNRpYO9PLK Recorded an episode of one of my favorite podcasts: @EscThisPodcast, where players figure out how to escape a themed room filled with puzzles, locks, codes, and all sorts of clever escape room trickery. Mine comes out soon, but I\u2019d suggest you subscribe and start listening now. Are you watching the @HBO documentary WIG? It premieres tonight, and I\u2019m so proud of it. Hard to believe that only 18 months ago @DavidBurtka had the idea of reviving the @LadyBunny77 all day drag festival Wigstock, and now a film exists to captures the show and so much more. https://t.co/9Qt4oYgy4W @Andy You have any contacts there? Drawback to #TelAvivPride being so successful: we went out tonight and every gay bar was so nutso crowded we wound up going back to the hotel. Harrumph. Perhaps tomorrow, Tel Aviv. I\u2019m anxious to see your sights. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 Pumped at the stellar job @winehive did making me look super fancy with this new wine storage.

Its palate made me want to touch and smell and feel and dance. Such specific talent showcased brilliantly. @reevecarney is sickening, and he is but one of many. Go see this cast! #TonyAwards Honored to be a part of the discussion on LGBTQ rights with @EW and some truly incredible advocates. #lgbtq #pride https://t.co/uv68rxOjyZ https://t.co/idUpmNcIcX The new iPhone update claimed that I can use my phone to pay for subway rides, and what, whaaat? - IT WORKS! #awesome #apple #phoningitin #thefuture #MTA #fourfivesix https://t.co/WXZ7qXMYrQ Watched I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson (@RAeSTimR) on an airplane and was laughing so hard that other passengers were getting concerned. Binge on @netflix if funny is your flavor. Sad that this still exists in the world. Happy that @RainbowRailroad is saving lives. https://t.co/nNkSlnJQop RT @doctorofflaws: And to think Jaime only needed to hug Cersei right there #GoT https://t.co/J8ZlNb2qsO Tim Conway made me laugh harder than almost anyone on TV, ever. He shaped my sense of humor, inspired my love for comedy. So sad to lose someone so funny. #RIP https://t.co/XAcNxWbylm Looking forward to it.

We shopped for her brother, got our nails did, and crushed some crudo at @Eataly. This is the best age! For both of us! #scallops #urchin #grateful\u2026 https://t.co/i4AJvpvhC2 I\u2019ve partnered with #JifPowerUps to present a solution to the age-old snack-time struggle that is SO REAL in the Burkta-Harris house: kids want delicious, parents want wholesome. Share your snack-time struggle stories with #JifPowerUps for a chance to be in an upcoming live show. https://t.co/g16ntwwujH Last minute Father\u2019s Day gift, perhaps? @InandOfItself https://t.co/cUiNIh0ZNH I received an awesome bunch of birthday gifts from an awesome bunch of people - thanks Twitter! As I was (mostly) joking about wanting lots of presents, I want to show my appreciation with a gift of my own: a donation to the @ACLU. (Yass @chrissyteigen!) https://t.co/XAr5i3ce8x 59 years ago today, the Submarine Voyage opened at the @Disneyland Resort. Exactly 14 years later, my mother was about to launch her own lil\u2019 Nautilus vessel into the world. #Eticket What I want for my birthday, Part Last: for anyone irked by this bit to know I\u2019m not being serious, I do this every year, and it\u2019s mainly just to mention things I think are cool. Happy hump day! Sincere apologies to @Racheldoesstuff for my Tony tweet. I failed to research her before pressing \u2018send\u2019, and what I thought was a funny comment in our living room must have been far from funny to read, backstage, mid show. As a performer and a parent, I should have know better. Things I want for my birthday, Part Four: a melodica. It\u2019s a keyboard that you play by breathing into a tube on the end. Also known as a \u2018blow organ\u2019 but, umm, I\u2019m, err, probably better off calling it a melodica. https://t.co/QCsvciaBOV What I want for my birthday, Part Three: automatons. Moving mechanical marvels, either vintage or contemporary, like this from the amazing Thomas Kuntz. Awesome.  https://t.co/LxSMcBbzPb What I want for my birthday, Part Two: a newfound resolve to meditate and focus. To calm my mind and create a space for - oh, oh! - and any new VR games for @OculusRift and/or @htcvive! VR is soooo dope, yo! What I want for my birthday, Part One: anything designed by @elonmusk, or any intel on what future technologies he\u2019s creating. Cough, cough, 2 day shipping with @amazonprimenow, cough! Congrats to the entire @TheTonyAwards production team. It\u2019s a beast, and you tamed is incredibly well. So many performances, so many awards. Not an easy task. Well played. @Racheldoesstuff @TheTonyAwards Indeed! Well said. Thanks for the reminder. How was backstage? @MaryColon @thealexnewell @springsteen Seriously? Miking Actors isn\u2019t because they can\u2019t project, it\u2019s for creating a proper sound mix. Using a teleprompter is just not being willing to memorize your lines. The director should have said something. Oh wait. @pope_meredith11 @thealexnewell @springsteen Umm, yes he was. How was @thealexnewell not nominated for a Tony? @springsteen won, and he uses teleprompters. I don\u2019t get the logic... #livetweetingtheTonys It\u2019s hard to watch @TheTonyAwards. I miss it. Who is the woman in the top hat backstage at @TheTonyAwards? Gideon remarked that she says \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018oh my god\u2019 a lot. I\u2019m confused... Holy wow, watching @carouselbway makes me love  @TheTonyAwards! My birthday is less than a week away. Still plenty of time for gifts to arrive. Address in bio. Thanks in advance. I love it/them. Any suggestions on which video game platform might be best suited for 7 year old boy/girl twins? PlayStation? Nintendo? Intellivision? What\u2019s better for first graders? Are there new technologies? Games that aren\u2019t super violent? Oh wow, I sound old... #help Today is my awesome husband @Davidburtka \u2018s birthday! I want this day to feel special - he deserves it - so if you have a free minute send him a tweet! https://t.co/AJKpt66IID I\u2019m contemplative, appreciative, and thankful this Memorial Day. I raise a solemn glass to all who gave their lives serving the military of the United States of America, fighting for our freedoms. #grateful Saw \u2018Solo\u2019 (@StarWars_EpIX) with the family yesterday. We enjoyed, but at times it felt tepid. Would have been 100x awesomer if @philiplord and @chrizmillr had been allowed to direct the whole thing. Just sayin\u2019. Those dudes rule. Just saw both parts of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on B\u2019way (@HPPlayNYC) and...wow. It is to plays what Hamilton is to musicals. Stop what you\u2019re doing and see this magical show. Poetic, dramatic, respectful, exciting. The cast is sublime. Must. See. #gobsmacked https://t.co/OCgz32fCC3 Who will be crowned Genius Junior Champions?

Bravo to @netflix and @Unfortunate  https://t.co/zbVz0QMeK0 Sad about Barbara Bush\u2019s passing. She lived quite a life - relocated her family 27 times, thrived in multiple presidential bubbles, accomplished lots as a First Lady, fought for global literacy - and showed humor and class through it all. May she rest in peace. RT @AdCouncil: As we see our fellow Americans getting fired, evicted &amp; denied services simply for being gay or transgender, we\u2019re reminding\u2026 Stunned by the passing of Harry Anderson, one of my comedy and magic inspirations growing up. We became friendly over the years - he worked at the @MagicCastle_AMA and recently sold me a handful of great magic memorabilia. My sincere condolences to his family. #RIP https://t.co/k9FITPIaBS Don\u2019t forget to watch @NBCGeniusJunior tonight. The six kids we showcase forget verrrry little.

She is a gorgeous, fearless, vocal powerhouse dancing acrobat super hero and I want to run away and join her circus. https://t.co/gIId0kyY5t Just one example of the uncanny braininess these kids showcase on Sunday\u2019s @NBCGeniusJunior.

Even when interviewing the Bachelor and his (current) betrothed. #goodtimes I thought @jimmykimmel was an excellent Oscar host last night. He\u2019s classy, clever, and makes it all look so easy (which it most decidedly isn\u2019t). The fact that he\u2019s one of the nicer people you\u2019ll ever meet is just gravy.

RT @Davidburtka: May this heart be with you! http://t.co/mYv5NzjG0A RT @Davidburtka: I am giving everyone a big kiss for Valentine\u2019s Day!! http://t.co/nRz1B2OOGU \u201c@Davidburtka: I\u2019ll think about it okay yes!\u201d Yes! If my Valentine's night was now up for an Oscar, it'd be for Best Original Score! Hey @Davidburtka - Will you be my Valentine? Ok, I realize you're already my husband, but a 'yes' would sure make my day/night/life. Congrats to the North Carolina Powerball winner! Way to make winning an #Oscar seem that much less impressive. @TheAcademy Rehearsals are intense for the Oscars.  And by rehearsals, I mean me singing\ninto a hairbrush in front of a mirror.  #Oscars2015 @TheAcademy Had a tremendous meal last night at @MVinkLA. Massively impressed by food is both exquisite to look at and delicious. http://t.co/YS1IckPucT Tonight, I'll be joining the hilarious @PaulGreenberg1 in the season finale of @IGIHollywood at 8:30e/p only on @AudienceDIRECTV #haunted Looking over the preparations for the #Oscars set. After last night, we've installed a second layer of Kanye-proofing, just in case. As always, unbelievable respect for the crew working backstage at the Grammys. Changing out set after set - their work is amazing. GAH! Our best of friends just had a child! Sorry Grammys, but the godfathers have to meet themselves a new baby! #goodnight Hmmm. Jamie Foxx reading braille next to Stevie Wonder. Not sure how to feel about that. Amazing. Beck and Chris Martin sure did... stand there super well. So much energy! Sam Smith is awesome. Who knew Kristen Wiig was such an amazing dancer! Wait. I think someone put something in my drink. This ain't right. #whatishappening Shia Lebouf sure knows how to read a teleprompter. Prince is so shiny..! Sam Smith is awesome. Add Mary J. Blige- just wow. \"This would be a real good tiiiiime.. to take a nap.\" Just loving the Grammys. Thanks to CBS and Jack Sussman for creating such an amazing show, year in and year out. If you get a chance, GO! Usher can sing. But did that harpist come from the Ariana Grande school of hair design? It's Ga Ga Game time! http://t.co/z8cYAQOT95 Wow. That was awesome. @katyperry as Princess Leia has never sounded better. Pharrell just can't stop wearing shorts..! Is this a Wes Anderson movie? Does he work at the Grammy Budapest Hotel? So @Davidburtka and I have agreed that if Nick Jonas responds to this tweet, our wedding vows will sort of kind of change a bit. Annie Lennox is awesome. Not only can she sing, but her bird calls worked! They are everywhere! #don'tcare #standingovation Annie Lenox makes everything better. Especially church. Adam Levine must be some sort of super hero person. Doesn't he want to have my baby? Gwen Stafani must be some sort of super hero person. Didn't she just have a baby?? I thought Beyonc\u00e9 had a middle part, not a beehive. #goodtoknow Josh Duhamel is everything. Madonna is losing the Running of the Bulls. Oh wait, here comes a gospel choir. She's good. Oh, no. She's dead. She lost. Sam Smith is awesome. Who knew Miranda Lambert's set designer was her biggest fan? She's hot, but cool. Pharrell is actively disrespecting everyone on the frozen East Coast by wearing shorts in the winter. #howdareyousir Marion Cotillard is up for an Oscar AND singing on the Grammys with Tom Jones? What can't she do?!? Ariana Grande's eyelids seem really heavy. Anna Kendrick looks hot. No bra. Well played. I'm one envelope away from seeing Taylor Swift's lady parts. LL Cool J is talking. All I can hear is ringing in my ears. I think they're bleeding. #oldpersonjoke AC-DC opened then show, and now everyone is effectively deafened. And I think six people had seizures. And 50+ got 3rd degree burns. I gotsta live tweet the Grammys! Get ready: as a non-winner, I'm eleven drinks in. Aw, nerts..! We didn't win a Grammy for @HedwigOnBway. Kudos to Beautiful, but @stephentrask's music still rules my rock-ish world. Thinking of going with a solid gold tuxedo for Oscar night. Thoughts? #chafing @TheAcademy In honor of Birdman, we\u2019re going to do the whole #Oscars broadcast in one continuous shot. Calling all foodies: Watch my bud @ChefAntonioPark's debut on Chopped Canada tonight at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT - Food Network. Oof. I am knee deep in #Oscars rehearsals. Why, oh why did I ask for a wading pool... Good on us, Lance and Michael.

Today we honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a remarkable humanitarian and civil rights leader. #greatness #respect Another good #Oscar read, again via Deadline: http://t.co/ml04aDrP8v Interested in a smart, insider conversation about this year's #Oscar drama?

And I should know, I filmed it. #Marjorie The Oscar nominations come out tomorrow morning. Damn, I really need to finish counting all these ballots..! #Oscars #procrastination RT @billboard: We spoke to @ActuallyNPH about #Hedwig's Grammy nomination and more: http://t.co/dQbN1TQn4S My stint in the American Horror Story: Freak Show begins tonight!

Great article in the NY Times today re: immersive theatre. First Sleep No More, now The Great Comet, Here Lies Love &amp; Murder Ballad? Yay!! Proud of Nik Wallenda for his epic high wire walk.

Well thought out gifts. So\u2026 tick tock. Oh, wait. Scratch that last tweet. I thought turning 40 would bring enlightenment. It doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m still pretty dim. So weird. I woke up this morning with infinite wisdom. Not sure why\u2026 Watch the amazing director and exec producer Glenn Weiss, in the truck, calling the shots for the Tony live TV feed: http://t.co/Dq3wxDEoWH Umm, yes please.\n\nhttp://t.co/lpebD6KkNJ Funny, draggy Downton Abbey spoof.  And, @DavidBurtka has a cameo! http://t.co/LVyT43wk1W I just love @Colossal and the amazingly creative art he curates. Check out these phenomenal origami creations: http://t.co/B2YBUJbPqI But truly, last night made me love theatre and revere the amazing and tireless performers working so hard each night. \u2018Twas a great time. Really, Daily Mail?!? The N-word? That\u2019s your story?!? I would NEVER be so disrespectful and frankly, neither should you. And while I\u2019m at it, thanks to everyone that watched this year\u2019s Tonys. We had the highest ratings in YEARS! Much, much appreciated. Also, thanks to @emmgroupnyc for hosting our post show shindig. And for @thegeneralnyc for the giant doughnut cake. http://t.co/9mwuT5lIpy Such fun last night hosting the @TheTonyAwards. A BIG thanks to the 121 performers from every show that played along. You\u2019re remarkable! Please watch @TheTonyAwards tomorrow. Everyone works so hard on Broadway. I\u2019m jumping through hoops to assure a good night. #OneDayMore Just saw Kinky Boots on B\u2019way. Infectious show, tons of fun, made me cry. Cast is stellar, and @AnaleighAshford is a star! New York is the best! After Tony rehearsing, I had a fantastic meal with friends at Uncle Boons, comfort thai food in Soho. #delicious Just arrived into NYC! Get ready, @TheTonyAwards, time to get to work! #OneWeekMore I\u2019ve re-newly fallen in love with green chiles. They put them on everything here in NM: burgers, eggs, cereal, pudding. I\u2019m obsessed. \u201c@tropangadam: @ActuallyNPH is hosting the tonys and the emmys! double yay!\u201d Look at me. Pulling the Bi-fecta. Pssst, listen: today is @Davidburtka \u2019s birthday. Let\u2019s hide and on the count of three jump out, surprise him, and sing! One, two, THREE! Had an absolutely wonderful and creative time with the kids at the Santa Fe Children\u2019s Museum. One of the best we\u2019ve ever seen! Loved it! Tired legs from a dance rehearsal for a big production number. How did I end up dancing so much? My twins have taken more lessons than me! I just can't believe the scale of that tornado that touched down in Moore. A mile wide?!? My condolences go out to everyone affected. Hey, check out this pocket watch! &lt;tick tick tick\u2026&gt; YOU ARE NOW HYPNOTIZED. WATCH THE #GOODWINGAMES TONIGHT ON FOX! PASS IT ON! &lt;snap&gt; Bwaa! Dude! Tomorrow night, on Fox, is the premiere of The Goodwin Games. Please watch. I directed an episode. Great show. I promise. Santa Fe is filled with middle aged people who don\u2019t care what they act like. The good kind of mid life crisis. It\u2019s oddly inspiring. Free ep of the #goodwingames on hulu NOW! It\u2019s by the HIMYM guys so you know the Q in the title, if it existed, would stand for quality. Shooting scenes for @SethMacFarlane \u2018s awesome new western film. You won\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve done all day. #physicalcomedemented Season finale of HIMYM tonight. I promise you, it\u2019s well worth watching\u2026 #watercooler My mom gives the best hugs.

Amazing night for #racertoeraseMS http://t.co/OA4gpewTXH RT @mstockett119: @ActuallyNPH don't retweet this #pointlesstweet Artistic photo during work out w/ super trainer @Jeremy_Cisneros at the @Equinox in Woodland Hills. #12reps1pic http://t.co/Jl7TKIbKaa The fantastic @Colossal has found another gem.

RT @Bluesfan2181: @ActuallyNPH this helped me make a little more sense of it all... Well said @pattonoswalt http://t.co/SKockB6O5d I wasn\u2019t making light in my last tweet. It\u2019s all just so random and sad. \u201c@mindmessed: Violence is never random; chaos never truly unpredictable.\u201d  It is if you\u2019re the poor person standing next to the bomber. Sending all good thoughts to Boston, after the madness. Makes me so sad. So crazy to think that violence can happen so randomly. Orphans is rad. Long live @ABFoundation. Can\u2019t say enough about Cinderella. It\u2019s the new Wicked. @LauraOsnes is perfect. The whole cast is! Bees seeing lots of B\u2019way theatre: Hands on a Hard Body closed too early.

When I am with @DavidBurtka, Paris is steamy and culinarily complex. When I am alone, Paris is rainy and underseasoned. #homesick Annnnnd, scene. Ug. What a day. I need a smoke. No matches. There's a lit candle, nice. What's with these cracks in the sidewalk? I'll use the stree - WHAM! You won't believe this! The mirror slipped out of my hands and is now cracked! Merde! What did I ever do to deserve all this?!? Damnit. Dropped the salt shaker accidentally. Salt is everywhere. Oh well. Not my day, I guess. At least this mirror is still intact... I just bought an adorable victorian hand mirror and a small crystal salt shaker - still filled with salt!  What luck! Found a cool antique store while walking around Paris. Weirdly, my umbrella won't seem to stay closed while I'm shopping in here. Oh well. So hard to tweet while I walk. And all of this construction on the street! Oh, wait. There's a space there under that ladder. Perfect. Happy Friday the 13th! Have a great day! Ooh, look - a kitty walking my way. Dark as night. Here, kitty!  Aw man, she went right by me... Looking forward to the new Big Brother tonight. But if there aren't any super hot people that are also cool, I'm out! #MajorTimeCommitment I was very moved by this story when I read about it at @tlrd, happy to hear its becoming a documentary.
