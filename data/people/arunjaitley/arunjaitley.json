demise of Sushmaji. She was one of the most outstanding politicians in the Present Era. She distinguished in all positions. She held Senior Positions with the Party, NDA Govt. &amp; while in opposition. She leaves behind a void which is difficult to fill. Congress Party, as a \u2018headless chicken\u2019, is further consolidating its alienation from the people of India. The New India has changed. Only the Congress does not realise this. The Congress leadership is determined to succeed in its race to the bottom. The level of support has compelled several opposition parties to support this move. They sensed the ground reality and do not want to face the wrath of the people. Regrettably, the Congress Party legacy, which first created the problem and then added to it, fails to see reason. India\u2019s most beautiful State has not had investments from even the hotel chains. Consequently, there are no new jobs, no revenue for the State. These constitutional provisions are not cast in stone. They had to be removed/ diluted through the due process of law that is done now. The decision to reverse the situation created by Panditji needed clarity, vision and determination. It also needed political courage. The Prime Minister has created history through his absolute clarity and determination. The last ten months have not seen any protest. Not even in Srinagar. Law and order enforcement, making life safe for lakhs of Kashmiris and pressuring handful of separatists and terrorists has been at its best. The next logical step obviously is total integration of the State. In the last seven decades, attempts to resolve the issue proved a disaster, PM Modi decided to follow an alternative approach. The present decision makes it clear that just as the rule of law prevails in other parts of the country, it will equally prevail in the Kashmir valley. The historic blunders of special status had cost the country politically and financially. Today, when history is being re-written, it proves that Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee\u2019s vision on Kashmir was the correct one and Panditji\u2019s dream solution has proved to be a failure. By 1989-90, the situation of J&amp;K had gone out of control and separatism with terrorism picked up. Kashmiri pundits, an essential part of Kashmiriat, suffered such atrocities which only the Nazis had inflicted in the past. The ethnic cleansing took place and they had to move out. The J&amp;K history of the past seven decades shows that the journey of this separate Status has been towards separatism and not integration. It created a separatist psyche. Pakistan was more than enthusiastic in trying to exploit the situation. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Home Minister Shri Amit Shah achieved the Impossible with the new Kashmir policy. In my blog today, I have analysed the impact of this decision, and history of failed attempts on resolving the J&amp;K issue. PM Narendra Modi and HM Amit Shah Achieve the Impossible    https://t.co/u6mznehB76 Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have earned a place in history. The clarity and determination which they have shown today proves \u2018Modi hai toh Mumkin hai\u2019. Congratulations to the entire nation. My complements to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji and the Home Minister Shri Amit Shah for correcting a historical blunder. A historical wrong has been undone today. Article 35A came through the back door without following the procedure under Article 368 of the Constitution of India. It had to go. Separate status led to separatism. No dynamic nation can allow this situation to continue. What was a temporary and transient provision cannot be treated as permanent. It had to go. J&amp;K integration with India took place in October 1947. Article 370 came into force in 1952, Article 35A came in 1954, four and seven years later respectively. How can Articles 370 and 35A be a condition precedent to merger? Read my blog dated 28th March, 2019 on Article 35A https://t.co/1tmX9w5JTw While the Article 370 and Article 35A decision benefits the residents of J&amp;K the most, the Kashmir regional leaders feel that they will not be able to whip up the fake issue of \u2018sentiment vs. benefit\u2019 to the people. The decision of the government will help the people of J&amp;K the Most. More investment, more industry, more private educational institutions, more jobs and more revenue. The government\u2019s decision in relation to Article 370 is a monumental decision towards National integration. Birthday greetings to Shri Vijay Rupani Ji, Chief Minister of Gujarat. May he be blessed with good health, long life and a successful year ahead. @vijayrupanibjp It\u2019s stand in both the Shah Bano case and now in the legislation emanating from the Shayara Bano case, it has given a clear evidence of its intent. It does not mind Muslim women being driven to destitution. After all, the fundamentalist vote bank is at a higher priority. Merely to oppose a progressive legislation, one does not have to invent a new jurisprudence. The Congress Party amended several personal laws to make them acceptable to the changing social mindset. But when it comes to the Shariat, it is scared. Some said why make a civil relation into a criminal offence. They must know that dowry, indulging in bigamy or polygamy, causing mental cruelty are all criminal offences. A bounced cheque or a defamation may be a civil wrong but both have penal consequences in criminal law. I have no doubt that once an example is made out of some people under the new law, the fear of its consequences will lead to minimising this practice. In absence of this law the Supreme Court's order will turn into a futile academic exercise. The Supreme Court, by striking down the practice of \u201cTriple Talaq\u201d, has merely made a declaration of the law. This declaration has to be followed by a legislation which punishes the offending spouse for indulging in this cruel act despite it being declared unlawful. In a society governed by Constitution and the Rule of law, prima facie, this practice of oral divorce violates both the right to equality and the right of a woman to live with dignity. I have consistently held the opinion that there must be a recognised distinction between the right to practice and propagate ones religion. How do you reconcile provisions of personal law which violate fundamental rights? The answer would be the harmonious construction. Those who opposed the Triple Talaq Bill stand exposed because what they have attempted today by raising farcical objections, is to continue and defend an obsolete practice that promotes injustice. The 'liberals' raised weak arguments so that the fundamentalists amongst the Muslims are kept happy. Assume, what if such a provision existed in Hindu law? Liberals, leftists, women organisations would have been shocked &amp; would have attempted for repeal of such law or practice. The Triple Talaq Bill has exposed all the pseudo \u2018liberals\u2019. A \u2018liberal\u2019 should ordinarily be hostile to the idea of discrimination and injustice perpetuated by an oral divorce. In this case, not one spoke in favour of the Bill which is ending the injustice. \u2018Talaq\u2019 without a Social Security    https://t.co/krOLzoML6q Saddened to know about the demise of eminent economist and former RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn.

Will Pakistan use this opportunity or will they squander it? Pakistan is now under a global gaze as to what direction it follows. The ICJ\u2019s observation on the nature of review and reconsideration is an example of legal craftsmanship in judgement writing. In paragraphs 139 to 147 it gives a clear indication amounting to a mandatory direction as to what is the nature of remedy available to Jadhav. The ICJ judgement in Jadhav case is a comprehensive victory for India. Pakistan lost conclusively before the ICJ.  It\u2019s farcical processes through which innocent are held guilty, stand exposed. A plain reading of the ICJ judgement in Jadhav's case shows that India won on almost all counts. What surprised many was the official claim of Pakistan that the judgement is, in fact, a Pakistani victory. I have exposed this farcical Pakistani claim in my blog today.

May he be blessed with good health and a long life. @rajnathsingh A major tax incentive has been given to those who borrow to buy affordable houses.  This move will not merely help the system to utilise the unsold stock of affordable houses but will also be instrumental in injecting liquidity into the real estate market. It is the softening of the crude oil prices which has persuaded the Govt. to raise the excise duty on petrol &amp; diesel marginally.This money goes into an infrastructure fund. In the last two years though the crude oil prices hardened yet duties had been cut by the Central Government on at least two occasions in a major way. We are currently witnessing a growth moderation for two to three quarters due to various factors. However, the Budget 2019-20 unquestionably, as a policy document, with high trust on leadership of PM @narendramodi ji, lays down the roadmap for India to get back on track. The income-tax exemption limit having been increased to \u20b95 lakh in the interim Budget, several sectors of interest to the middle and the neo-middle class have been incentivised. These, in particular, include affordable housing and electric vehicles. The Budget contemplates massive infrastructure creation which will generate employment and attract investment. Similarly gives a boost to the construction and real estate sector. With this India will continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. The present Budget maintains the path of fiscal discipline based on the premise that economies which are fiscally prudent eventually get rewarded as against those who indulge in fiscal adventurism. The Budget presented by FM, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, is a policy document for the medium term. It expands the roadmap on which the Prime Minister has built up India\u2019s growth story from 2014-19. The striking part of this period was that for a 5 year average, India grew by 7.3%. The Union Budget 2019-20 gives a political direction for an aspirational India. The economically weaker sections get the basic amenities of life. The Prime Minister\u2019s first tenure witnessed the blending of good economics &amp; good politics. The trend continues in this Budget.

I am sure this trend will continue in future. In the pre-GST regime, the rich &amp; the poor, on various commodities, paid the same tax. The multiple slab system not only checked inflation, it also ensured that the Aam Aadmi products are not exorbitantly taxed. A Hawai chappal &amp; a Mercedes car cannot be taxed at the same rate. The assessee base in the last two years has increased by 84%. The number of assessees covered under GST today are at 1.20 crore. This obviously leads to higher revenue collections. As on today, most consumer items have been brought in the 18%, 12% &amp; 5% GST category. Only luxury, sin &amp; some white goods remain in 28% slab. A sudden reduction of all categories can lead to a massive loss of government revenue leaving the government without resources to spend. The high taxation of pre GST era pinched the consumers\u2019 pocket and acted as a disincentive against tax compliance.  The last two years have seen each of the meetings of the GST Council reducing the tax burden on consumers as the tax collections improved. The GST merged seventeen different laws and created single taxation, with this new system the days of filing multiple returns, entertaining multiple inspectors and additionally facing the inefficiency - trucks being stranded at the State boundaries for days altogether, vanished. In pre GST era the States had multiple laws which entitled them to impose taxation at different points. The States were scared of the fear of the unknown but the Central Govt. persuaded States with a 14% annual increase from the tax base of 2015-16 for a period of five years. Today, the GST regime enters its third year. It has been the monumental restructuring of one of the world's clumsiest indirect tax system. The challenges to implement the GST were compounded by some outlandish and exaggerated comments of the not so well-informed.

His nationalistic ideals, patriotism and courage guided generations of Indians. We bow to Veer Savarkar. Heartiest greetings to Shri Nitin Gadkari ji on his birthday. May he be blessed with a long healthy life and a successful year ahead. @nitin_gadkari Saddened beyond words to know about the fire tragedy in Surat. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I pray for the speedy recovery of all those injured in this tragic incident. Aspirational India has proved it once again that India wants growth and a leadership that believes in country first &amp; acts tirelessly for the people. Let us work together &amp; make lives of every countrymen better. Jai Hind. #VijayiBharat Fake issues don\u2019t work. The final results point in the same direction as the exit polls. What is the accountability of those who were bringing a bad name to India\u2019s democracy both domestically and internationally by raking up the VVPAT issue? Aspirational India does not accept Royalties, Dynasties and caste based parties. Our gratitude to the people of India for reposing their faith in the BJP/NDA. Congratulations to the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, all the NDA and BJP workers for achieving this miraculous win in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Prime Minister\u2019s style of rising above caste &amp; concentrating on performance related issues received far more acceptability with the electorate. I re-assert my earlier hypothesis that in the Congress the first family is no longer an asset but an albatross around neck of the Party. Fake issues only satisfy the \u2018manufacturers of fakery\u2019.  The voters don\u2019t buy them. The personalised campaign against Prime Minister Modi did not cut much ice in 2014 and may not cut any ice in 2019. Leaders in New India are judged on merit and not on caste or family names. The arithmetic of caste coalitions loses to the chemistry on the ground &amp; voters don\u2019t elect hung Parliament where ugly and untenable coalitions have a role to play. This chemistry is in form of catching imagination of the people of India on issues of national interest. The evolving \u2018New India\u2019 will accept structured parties with talent, &amp; ideological clarity concentrating on performance. If, however, the political parties are unwilling to get the message of 2014 and the possibly of 2019, then alienation from the electorate will only widen. Dynastic parties, caste parties and the Obstructionists Left received a setback in 2014. This will be reiterated loud and clear in 2019. \u2018Coalition of Rivals\u2019 are untenable alliances and the voters do not trust them. Political analysts are confused but the voters are clear. The Exit Polls also show that electorate keeps national interest paramount before exercising a choice on whom to vote for.  When well-meaning people with similar ideas vote in the same direction, it leads to the making of a wave &amp; maturing of Indian democracy. When the results of Exit Polls and final results on the 23rd May, 2019 go in the same direction, the Opposition\u2019s fake issue of the EVMs would also lose its non-existent rationale. Those questioning accuracy of Exit Polls must know the hard reality that when multiple Exit Polls convey the same message, the direction of the result broadly would be in consonance with the message.  Exit Polls are based on personal interviews and the EVMs have no role. The Message of Exit Polls  https://t.co/ciQBprCs3E Greetings on the auspicious occasion of #BuddhaPurnima.\n\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u0905\u0935\u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964 https://t.co/mZZcVUYpL7 Birthday greetings to Dr. Thawarchand Gehlot ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet. May he be blessed with good health, long life &amp; a successful year ahead. @TCGEHLOT I have long argued that aspirational India look for a better tomorrow. They are averse to suicidal choices. The Scary scenario that the Opposition promises will be singularly responsible for its rout in the 2019 LS elections. This consolidates the groundswell in favour of Modi. The Opposition\u2019s attack on the EVMs and the Election Commission is an advance alibi for their defeat on the 23rd May, 2019.  Their leaders represent temperamental mavericks, some highly corrupt and many - a governance disaster. No Indian is believing their assurance that they can come together after the election?  They are institution wreckers.  They do not allow Parliament to function. They attack and intimidate Judges.  Now Election Commission is their next target. The common thread which brings Opposition together is negativism \u2013 to get rid of one person. They have no agreement on either a leader or programme. They are a fractured Opposition which could not come together before or during the election. The not so positive reason for the Prime Minister\u2019s high acceptability levels is the absence of any cogent or coherent alternative, the \u2018TINA\u2019 factor. Which means that the Opposition is giving vague &amp; unreliable alternative, the same is either too scary or absolutely frightening. The Enormity of Prime Minister\u2019s public rallies, the positivity of his decisiveness, integrity, performance, delivery of resources to the poor, and security doctrine has been a game changer. With multiple reasons PM\u2019s acceptability with people of India is continuously growing. With seventh &amp; final phase of 2019 LS elections approaching closure, groundswell in favour of Prime Minister Modi is becoming stronger. Except in the last few days, no political analyst had foreseen the velocity of this groundswell even in a State like Bengal. The Frightening and Scary Scenario of India\u2019s Opposition    https://t.co/OAjZo9CemI A free campaign is not possible and therefore the campaign has to be cut short. This is a classical case of breakdown of the Constitutional Machinery. A constitutional authority, the Election Commission of India, has effectively held Bengal to be a state in Anarchy. Repeatedly escalating violence, state supported Vandals, a partisan police and home department are the illustrations the ECI has given. \u0905\u092e\u0930 \u0936\u0939\u0940\u0926 \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u092f\u0902\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u092e\u0928 l Tributes to the great martyr Sukhdev on his Janm Jayanti https://t.co/AsspS1vh1z Keep it up Amit Bhai. Only Modi Ji and you can do in Bengal what others failed to realise. Victory is now at an arm\u2019s length distance. Has Bengal acquired a Government of Gangsters? The attack on Amit Shah\u2019s peaceful rally by the TMC is deplorable . Is a free &amp; fair Poll possible in Bengal? All eyes are now on the Election Commission. Humour, wit, sarcasm survive in a free society. They have no place in autocracies. Dictators laugh at people. They don\u2019t like people laughing at them. Bengal, today is a case in point. Why have the so called \u2018Left Liberals\u2019 gone into hiding? Behan Mayawati - She is firm on becoming a Prime Minister. Her governance, ethics and discourse stoops to an all-time low.  Her personal attack today on the Prime Minister exposes her as unfit for public life. Mamata Didi \u2013 Democracy has become a casualty in Bengal. Opposition workers are murdered, candidates are attacked, polling booths are captured and Opposition leaders are not entitled to organise rallies. This is what India\u2019s Opposition has to offer to the Nation. Saddened by the death of Yogi C Deveshwar, Chairman ITC. Yogi excelled as a corporate professional and an entrepreneur and took his company to great heights. May God render peace to the departed soul &amp; give to his family strength to bear this loss. \u092f\u0947 \u0924\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093e-\u0924\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0930, \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0964 https://t.co/FKGSle6iL6 The motivated news item of differences between the Attorney General and the government is absolutely incorrect. As one of the senior most members of the Bar, he certainly has his views on some issues. The Government respects him for the objectivity of his advice. The Indian electorate is clear that it wants a five year Government and not a five month one. It is thus confronted with the choice of a Modi vs. Chaos. Obviously, the electorate\u2019s wisdom has to be trusted when he makes a choice. The 2019 \u2018Modi mandate\u2019 could be larger than 2014. With strong pro-Modi trend visible amongst the voters, the Prime Ministerial contest is almost becoming a one horse race. Very rarely has India witnessed such a powerful ratings for an incumbent Prime Minister to be voted to power. Are the Opposition parties unable to figure out the \u2018Modi Modi\u2019 shouts confronting them when their leaders pass through crowded areas?\u00a0 Except for those who prefer to deceive themselves, media persons travelling across the country have a uniform report that there is a Modi wave. Today, dynasties are more ridiculed than cherished. The \u2018New India\u2019 judges performance of its leaders very harshly. It has tried and finally trusted the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The new generation of the Gandhis believes that national security is a non-issue. Voters want responsible governance, not political acrobatics by the leaders they trust. Congress Party will be shaken for failing to add any significant numbers to its 2014 tally.\u00a0 The anarchic Aam Aadmi Party could be reduced to virtually next to nothing in the election. Congress is reduced to a double digit party by Rahul Gandhi but congressmen are hoping against hope to break the double digit barrier. Mayawati is fully determined to throw her hat in the ring. Mamata Banerjee and Chandrababu Naidu believe that they are opposition\u2019s \u2018Sutradhars\u2019. With the counting day approaching closer, traditional political rivals have started open or secret parleys. Their best hope is that the Indian voter is neither wise nor sensible and hence would give an indecisive verdict.\u00a0 This presumption will be strongly belied on May 23, 2019. The Hope of the Losers  https://t.co/IqJnNsxs5t Will the Congress President oust his 'Guru', who rubbishes the genocide of India's most patriotic community in 1984? Sam Pitroda's 'Hua to Hua' reaction to the 1984 Sikh killings is reflective of the lack of remorse on the part of Congress Party with respect to the 1984 genocide. It is a matter of disgrace that the Congress Party has no remorse over the Sikh killings of 1984. Tributes to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore on his Jayanti. #RabindraJayanti, https://t.co/YQaITZseKY From May 1991 till 2004, the Congress blamed its present ally the DMK for Shri Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. It even withdrew support from the United Front government on this ground. 28 years later, today a desperate Congress has discovered a BJP role. From December 1990 till May 1991, when Shri Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, the Congress Party supported Chandra Shekhar government was in power. The Kaamdars use India\u2019s Naval assets to strike at terror. The Naamdars use them for personal vacations with family and in-laws. Saddened by the demise of Prof N.R. Madhava Menon, a legal educator, scholar &amp; jurist. He pioneered five year legal education &amp; law schools in India. I had the privilege of being taught by him. My thoughts are with his family &amp; students. May God render peace to the departed soul. Expansive reach of MCC may actually run it in the danger of being questioned for its constitutionality in relation to free speech. To avoid such a situation, the memorialist must keep in mind that the Right to Free Speech has not been diluted in any way by the MCC. Another case relates to the Gandhi Family principle of restrictive free speech. They can call even an honest Prime Minister a \u2018Chor.\u2019\u00a0 However, others don\u2019t possess this right. In recent cases, where the PM appealed to the first time voters, no party or candidate was mentioned.\u00a0 In another case, he made a reference to the demographic composition of the new constituency of Congress President. How these speeches are even considered violative of the MCC? The MCC and the Right to Free Speech have to co-exist. The MCC cannot encroach upon the Right to Free Speech. The two have to exist harmoniously. The Election Commission, therefore, is under an obligation not to dilute or compress Right to Free Speech. Before submitting memorandums for violation of the MCC in relation to contents of a political speech, everyone must bear in mind that the MCC has to be interpreted in order not to dilute the right to free speech but as subject to Right to Free Speech. The Right to Free Speech does not get suspended or diluted even during elections. Quite to the contrary, elections are the greatest celebration of Indian democracy.\u00a0 The sacrosanct Right of Free Speech has to be fully protected during this period. Of late, a tendency has developed amongst the political parties to excessively allege violation of the MCC by their opponents. In the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, the\u00a0Congress Party as the \u2018Cry Baby\u2019 of this election, is leading the pack. The Power exercised by the Election Commission under Article 324 cannot relate to areas which are covered by a legislation or regulation but will be confined to areas where legislation does not occupy any space. This principle applies with all force to the MCC. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is an extremely important and powerful instrument available to the Election Commission for the conduct of free and fair elections, which draws its strength from Article 324 of the Constitution of India. Model Code of Conduct Does Not Take Away the Right to Free Speech  https://t.co/P1bvwiQOXN The Congress and its\u2019 President can call an honest Prime Minister \u2018Chor\u2019. No Model Code of Conduct is preventing that. If the PM calls the Congress legacy as \u2018Corrupt No. 1\u2019 the Congress complains that the Model Code of Conduct is violated. Are there two Model Codes of Conduct? Today he regards the World\u2019s fastest growing major economy as disastrous. Dr. Manmohan Singh left behind in 2014 an economic slowdown, policy paralysis and corruption. He brought down his party to lowest ever strength in Parliament. India was a part of the fragile five. When an Economist turns into a politician, he looses sense of both economy and politics. Indira Gandhi was also assassinated and yet Congress is questioned about Emergency and Operation Blue Star. The Dynast can attack the integrity of India\u2019s Prime Minister \u2013 a man of utmost honesty. Does he believe that the dynasty does not have to answer any questions? Why is Rahul Gandhi so disturbed if integrity issues of the Rajiv Gandhi Government are raised? Why did Ottavio Quattrocchi get kickbacks in Bofors? Who was the \u2018Q\u2019 connection? No reply has come. Killing of @BJP4JnK leader Ghulam Mohammed Mir by terrorists is a condemnable act of violence. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with his family members. May the departed leader\u2019s soul rest in peace. Birthday greetings to Shri Manohar Lal Khattar ji, Chief Minister of Haryana.

Sharing my presser exposing defence deals of Rahul Gandhi, May 4, 2019 https://t.co/KTkOqD5Lm3 The Dynastic self illusion of Rahul Gandhi has created a disproportionate image of his abilities in his mind and he believes that the universe around him thinks alike. Rahul Gandhi is no exception of megalomaniacs. The Irony of every dynast is that he buys his own propaganda even if there are not too many others willing to accept it. Dynasts have a sense of entitlement. They believe as if they were born to rule. Gandhis suffer from this sense of entitlement. The Dynast belongs to a family which has been tainted through generations with corruption charges. How does he even claim to have succeeded in damaging the image of PM Modi whose acceptability ratings are close to 70% and Rahul is finding it difficult to even breach the 20% mark. The only way a dynast with a little acceptability in the country can react to the commoner who defeated him in 2014 &amp; on the way to repeat the same with bigger margin in 2019, is that \u2018I will damage his image'. Yesterday, Rahul Gandhi said, \u201cI have dismantled Modi\u2019s image\u201d, how do you damage the image of a person who is riding perhaps at the peak of his popularity?  How do you damage the reputation of a person who is known to be incredibly honest. Seems the Dynast is day dreaming. It is proved now that Rahul Gandhi concocts falsehood, as in the Rafale case he did, then starts believing his falsehood to be true and eventually dreams that the falsehood has destroyed his opponent. He does not gauge public opinion. He only talks but does not listen. Rahul\u2019s attitude is at complete variance with the traditional Congress Party's way of doing things.  His revenge against Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not going to succeed. It may well turn out to be a revenge perpetrated against the Congress by the Dynast himself.

Its parliamentary strength is down to 40 - 70 seats. Its stance on National security issues is not of a mainstream party. It is only the fringe who are \u2018Vote Katuas\u2019 Those who lack the understanding about the \u2018Model Code of Conduct\u2019 must examine its width and scope in detail. The MCC is subject to the fundamental right of free speech under Article 19(1) (a). The MCC has to harmoniously co-exist with the right to free speech. It is obvious that recent terrorist attacks, master minded by Masood Azhar, consolidated the global opinion against him. The UNSC recognition of Masood Azhar is endorsement of India\u2019s position. Every Indian should rejoice this. Why is the Congress Party so reluctant to even smile at this national success? Briefed media on India's diplomatic victory, May 2, 2019 https://t.co/i9ENi9TnOQ India stands vindicated. Masood Azhar is now a global terrorist. India is in safe hands. This marks a high point for the Prime Minister\u2019s foreign policy. Naxal attack on security personnel  in #Gadchiroli Maharashtra is a highly condemnable cowardice act. My thoughts are with the families of brave personnel who sacrificed their lives for the nation.

A large part of India started seeing a reason in this. The majority community was liberal, tolerant but no longer apologetic about its own religious credentials. The Congress never understood the power of this sleeping giant. The politics of minority polarisation continued by Congress &amp; others for their survival. In the 1980s &amp; 90s the senior BJP leader Sh. L.K. Advani, strongly argued against this &amp; a theocratic State, he said that secularism can no longer become a euphemism for majority bashing. The Nehruvian politics continued for decades, parties like SP, BSP, RJD &amp;, of late, the TMC, went a step further of the Congress. They created fear in the minds of minorities &amp; endeavoured to develop a vote combination of a specific caste or a group &amp; that of Muslim minority. Has Congress denounced the Nehruvian secularism &amp; Pt. Nehru?, who believed that Hinduism was old fashioned, fundamentalist &amp; obscurantist. Nehru ji believed that it stood in the way of developing a scientific temperament. Barring the BJP &amp; a few other groups none endorsed the VHP slogan \u201c\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u094b \u0939\u092e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u201d. Rather they denounced this slogan as symbol of communalism. But today, Congress candidate from Bhopal, Digvijay Singh is publically announcing \u201cI too am a proud Hindu\u201d. Majority bashers are discovering their religion with self-proclaimed title of a \u2018proud Hindu\u2019 or even a Punjabi Hindu Kshatriya. Today, even atheist will wear their religion &amp; caste on their sleeves. Elections, after all, is a convenient season for all the neo-converts. India, a land of patriotic people with a few fringe contrarians.\u00a0The fringe can be a disgruntled lot, getting disproportionate voice on electronic &amp; social media, but it cannot win elections.

A 65% to 70% approval rating for an incumbent Prime Minister is unprecedented in India. It is reflecting in the groundswell. Its writing on the wall \"Fir Ek Baar Modi Sarkar\". The Congress obviously is in no position to take on the regional parties or the BJP in the 2019 LS elections. Therefore, the only issue in the future phases is the width of the margin of victory of the BJP.  Will it be a repeat of 2014 in terms of votes or will it be more? The \u2018New India\u2019 is a positive India. It wants to look up rather than be cynical &amp; critical about their own country. It does not accept the negativism of Rahul, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee &amp; TDP. The People have complete trust in Shri @narendramodi ji to steer the New India. Rahul Gandhi, in the last one year, built up a fake narrative on Rafale and loan waiver to business houses, which was contrary to the truth. The fake issues evaporated and now strike no chord with the electorate. Voting for the first three phases of the Lok Sabha elections covering 303 parliamentary seats is over. Its time now in the favourite hindi heartland. The Congress desperation is loud &amp; clear, it seems the Congress has thrown its hands up. Congress Party is contesting the 2019 election on the 1971 agenda. It is not in sync with the times. The writing on the wall is loud and clear. Those who lived a life of entitlement all through, give up when 'the office' seems to be a distant dream.

The Gandhis must introspect the plight of Amethi and Raebareli in the last forty years and compare it to what the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has done in Varanasi in the past five years. Even a casual visitor to Varanasi would tell you the difference. Just repeating the same five sentences several times a day and not getting out of the obsession of \u2018\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930\u2019 does not impress the \u2018New India\u2019 any more. It is only juvenile where a family lives under an illusion that people will accept it irrespective of politics which persuades you to build a climax of Priyanka taking on the Prime Minister and then suffering the wrath of the anti-climax. The myths of Priyanka Gandhi stands demolished.

The Myth of \u2018Priyanka will make a difference\u2019 was worth a lakh. Today, the myth has lost its value. I had only hoped that Varanasi will give the New India an opportunity to decide the fate of a tried, tested and successful leader as against a new political dynast.

It may not be an exaggeration to say that their attempt is to create a mass-intimidation of Judges. What has always puzzled me is the Congress lending support to such fringe campaigns. Independent judiciary and free media are both essential for a vibrant democracy.  Both have to live with each other.  In order to co-exist, both must respect the respective rights of each of these institutions.  One cannot take upon itself the task of destroying the other. Most of such people subscribe to fringe ideologies &amp; ideas, it is regrettable that a section affiliated to the Congress Party tend to join them. Frequent attempts are made to get some Parliamentarians to sign Motion of Impeachment against judges &amp; CJI on unsustainable grounds. This section has found a convenient ally in a small but vocal section of the Bar. This section exploits the judicial refrain of excessively using the power of contempt. However, they themselves have no hesitation in contemptuous behaviour themselves. The last few years have witnessed the consolidation of \u2018institution destabilizers\u2019 in a major way. Many of these represent Left or ultra-Left views. They have no electoral base or popular support. However, they still have a disproportionate presence in the media and the academia. We should leave a matter involving the judiciary to the institution itself. It is the wisdom of the Court as to how they intend to deal with it. If those who peddle falsehood to destroy the institution are not dealt with in an exemplary manner, this trend will only accelerate. Complaints of the nature levelled against the CJI in the ordinary course are referred to the appropriate Committee. However, when the complainant distributes copies of her complaint to other puisne Judges &amp; the media to sensationalise her allegations, it ceases to be routine. India has always taken pride in its independent judiciary. Judges decide cases which deal with life of the common man as also the most powerful commercial and political interests. A judge is not in a popularity race. He owes his commitment only to law, Justice and fairness.

Aspirational India of today wants development in a great country and not caste &amp; dynastic politics. A major factor visible after two phases of elections is that for a large part of electorate, Prime Minister Modi appears to be the obvious choice. This is particularly true in the case of voters below 35 years of age. \u2018My vote is for Modi\u2019 is the general trend from the ground. A relevant question with changing socio-economic profile of India is \u2013 \u201cAre dynasties an asset or a liability for a party?\u201d Unquestionably the present generation of dynast has become a liability rather than an asset for the Congress Party. Opposition parties are running, to utter dislike of voters, a negative campaign to remove one man Narendra Modi, whose acceptability with the people is at 70%. The key campaign thrust of Congress has cracked up. The Country doesn\u2019t trust them to give long-lasting coalition. The BJP campaign is focussed on achievements of last five years, particularly relating to strengthening the poor and the middle-class, a clean Government and a special emphasis on national security. Its alliance is coherent &amp; issues being clearly projected. The first two rounds of the voting for the 2019 General Elections are over. The early trends &amp; initial lessons reveal that the BJP/ NDA campaign is focussed. Leadership of Shri Narendra Modi is overwhelmingly accepted by people &amp; there appears a strong groundswell in his favour. The Elections momentum is clearly with BJP &amp; PM @narendramodi ji. In terms of national leadership contest for a Prime Ministerial election, it is almost becoming a one man race. There is nobody else measuring up to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s level of capacity and acceptability. The direction of 2019 General Election is clear. The centre-stage is occupied by the BJP. In terms of leadership &amp; agenda, the Congress is failing to make any impact. Fight by regional parties is diluted as their leaders lack national vision with localised agenda.

The lower he sinks, the higher we rise. Dynasts are also subject to the Supreme Court.  Indian democracy does not permit them to rewrite Court orders. In Rahul Gandhi\u2019s politics, the Right to Free Speech includes the Right to Falsehood. Truth holds together.  Falsehood falls apart.  Rahul Gandhi needs to learn this preliminary lesson of public discourse. This challenge of Kashmir &amp; terrorism can obviously be resolved with a fresh approach which is firm against terror, determined to enforce the rule of law &amp; fully committed to total integration. A strong govt. &amp; a leader with clarity alone is capable of resolving Kashmir issue. An important question before the country is \u2013 who is best suited to handle the issue of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and terrorism?  It obviously can\u2019t be solved by those whose policies created the problem and are no longer willing to change their policies due to vote bank politics. The NDA supported in good faith a regime of the mainstream party in the State. But PDP remained in the clutches of Jamaat-e-Islami agenda. Thereafter, Central govt., for the last few months, has sent a clear message that terrorism will not be accepted in the Valley. The separatists virtually took-over the State in 1989-90 leading to a virtual civil disobedience. Atrocities were practiced on the minorities, the Kashmiri Pandits, the Sikhs &amp; others. Ethnic cleansing of the minorities was done in the State. The NC-Congress relationship was a paradox. From total trust in Sheikh Sahab to his arrest in 1953, from his reinstallation in 1976 to the dismissal of the Farooq Government in 1984 and installing a Government headed by Ghulam Mohd. Shah were amongst the many pitfalls. Instead of working for total integration, the party wanted a loose &amp; liberal constitutional arrangement with Articles 370 &amp; 35A with the State under an erroneous impression that this would further the cause of integration. This was a fraud on the people of India. The Congress Party is identified with the creation of the problem itself.  When Pakistan did not reconcile to Kashmir being a part of India, the Congress Party whisked the issue away.  It was its historical blunder on account of which we lost one-third of our territory. Thus the most important issue which, confronts India in the short, medium and even the long run, is how do we handle the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and terrorism emanating from Pakistan and from within? What is happening in the State of J&amp;K and terrorism? Where does India stand on the issue of national security &amp; terror? How such crucial issues are not real issues, for a stable India an early resolution of these issues is utmost. National security &amp; terrorism are the most important issues which concern India in the long run. All other \u2018real issues\u2019/challenges of development are capable of early resolution with growing economy as has been seen in the last 5 years of NDA government. Opposition parties believe that national security and terrorism related issues should not be matters of electoral debate as they are not real issues. They forget that it relates to our sovereignty and security.

Afterall, he got an M.Phil without a Masters degree. The Signature Campaign Propaganda proved to be terrible for the Congress party as many of academics, economists, artistes, ex-civil servants &amp; even some former soldiers, whose signatures been put, publicly stated that they never consented for putting their signatures. The BJP &amp; its allies are speaking directly to the people. Crores of campaigners are carrying the message of the party &amp; the govt. to the people. The Plight of the opposition campaign is that it could not built up a single major issue against the govt. in the past five years. To oust a popular govt. an extremely popular Prime Minister, you need real issues not fictional ones. The Opposition wasted the past two years in the run-up to the poll \u201cmanufacturing issues\u201d which didn\u2019t exist. The Rafale or the EVM proved to be fake issues only. On the leadership issue the situation of opposition parties look gloomier than what I had thought. The BSP leader Mayawati, the Trinamool leader Mamata Banerjee leave no stone unturned in running down the Congress President. No doubt it is advantage BJP. First phase of 2019 parliamentary polls got over &amp; the \u201cModi\u201d factor was writ large across the country. Opposition parties still renting an issue &amp; are in disarray as alliances in many States have not worked out. Obviously the multi-cornered contest favours the BJP. India\u2019s Opposition is on a \u201cRent a Cause\u201d Campaign   https://t.co/IYFUVl8dl7 Respectful tributes to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh.

Regrettably, none of the two State Governments have replied to the allegations on merits. An argument is being given by them as to why they are being singled out and their political rivals are not being searched. Similarly in Madhya Pradesh, an institutional mechanism has been created where money that is meant for development &amp; social welfare of the weaker sections are now being channeled into politics. In the public space evidence has come from Karnataka where allocations made to the PWD for public welfare were being round-tripped by engineers for a political purpose. It has become a growing culture of opposition parties to call any action against corruption as political vendetta. Legitimate action against corruption is no vendetta as claim of vendetta has never been a legitimate defence in corruption. Legitimate action against corruption is not vendetta    https://t.co/7jD8t20B0U Addressing investors at a roundtable in New York on \"India's reforms &amp; economic outlook\", April 9, 2019 https://t.co/Cgb4OCwS0A RT @IndiainNewYork: Mr. Arun Jaitley, Hon'ble Finance Minister of India addressing investors at a roundtable in New York on \"India's reform\u2026 Deeply anguished by the demise of Shri Bhima Mandavi, a dedicated BJP Karyakarta &amp; MLA, in Maoist attack  in Chhattisgarh.

It is anachronic. However, even while drafting this chapter, a new facility is sought to be provided to terrorists &amp; insurgents. The concept of cross media holding stands demolished with the advent of technology, How is public interest advanced that if you run one, medium, you should be barred from running another?  Is there a \u2018real and imminent danger\u2019 of monopolies being created? Congress must answer. The legislation proposed by the Congress in its 2019 manifesto to curb media freedom is ill advised as no restriction in Article 19(2) of the Constitution bears any nexus to the restriction now sought to be imposed. This will be vulnerable to any future constitutional challenge. It may be mentioned that the gentleman who drafted the manifesto is the same who had drafted the ill-fated Defamation Bill, 1988. That Bill provided for enhanced punishment for defamation upto five years. Today, while in Opposition, he wants to decriminalise defamation. It must be borne in mind that Indiraji, during the Emergency, had revoked the Press Council Act and abolished the Press Council by an Ordinance. Today, the Congress viciously wishes to strengthen it by allowing a Code of Conduct on coverage of event of national interest. The latest being the Congress manifesto 2019 which plans to destroy Institutions \n&amp; help Terrorists. It promises legislations to curb monopolies &amp; to bar cross media holdings to restrict free press. This will restrict simultaneous ownership of website, TV Channel &amp; newspaper etc. Curtailing press freedom has been tradition of Nehru-Gandhi family. Indiraji\u2019s passionate dislike for free media was well-known, she used to refer to India\u2019s leading newspapers as the \u2018monopoly press\u2019.

He had two companies \u2013 one with large number of assets and the other which had ostensibly duped thousands of investors. For generations the family did not earn from any commercial ventures.  They were in public service. All have led more than a comfortable life.  They enjoyed vacations at multiple domestic &amp; international locations. Surely, money comes from \u2018sweetheart deals\u2019 &amp; shady income. The duped investors requested the Central Government to amalgamate the two companies so that duped investors be paid. Till 2014, the UPA govt. did not take any action. It is only when the NDA govt. under Shri Narendra Modi was formed that the Dept. passed the amalgamation order. Amongst the names of the tenants, the critical person is Jignesh Shah of FTIL and the real estate developer Sanjay Chandra of M/s. Unitech builder.   Who else would enter into such a \u2018sweetheart deals\u2019 except the \u2018fly-by-night\u2019 operators who needed State patronage. A media expose revealed that the family owned a farm house in South Delhi which is now owned by the brother &amp; sister of current generation of the family. Periodically tenancies are created in favour of persons many of whom needed help when UPA was in power. The scion aspires to be a Prime Minister.  Such aspirants like Caesar\u2019s wife must be beyond suspicion. They must be unsuspectable. With tainted hands, he must at least remember that \u2018people in glass houses do not throw stones.\u2019 The \u2018Chowkidar\u2019 has finally caught a \u2018Chor.\u2019 You needed a \u2018Chowkidar\u2019 to catch a \u2018Chor. With regard to Unitech, the less said the better, besides the 2G favours shown, many flat buyers had been duped, their monies siphoned off and promoters, including one with whom Rahul Gandhi signed the arrangement, is still in prison. How to lead a comfortable life without having any apparent &amp; declared source of income? The leading answer is as Rahul Gandhi did through his \u2018Sweetheart Deals\u2019 with Fly-by-Night Operators.

It is an irresponsible document which has never to be implemented since Congress looks a certain loser. The Congress is the principal creator of the J&amp;K problem. It created a special status; it unconstitutionally brought in Article 35A. A reference to \u201cKashmiri Pandits\u2019 &amp; their ethnic cleansing is conspicuously absent in the Manifesto. It shows, how untrustworthy Congress is. Congress Manifesto promises Single Rate GST. This effectively means that luxury items, Aam Aadmi commodities, and food items, all should be taxed at the same rate. Rahul Gandhi got this wisdom from Singapore which has no poverty. So, the Manifesto does not care about the poor. Nyay, in the Manifesto, has now become a joint scheme of Central &amp; the State govts. thereby diluting the initial announcement that Nyay will be over &amp; above existing schemes. It is visible through Manifesto that \u201cNyay\u201d is an all time big Congress bluff. 2019 Congress Manifesto is a Charter to Weaken India. After reading Congress Manifesto my worst fears have come true.

This is a very transparent self goal. Constitutional federalism entails India as a \u2018Union of States\u2019, the Rights of the Union are equally important. If the States stand in way of Union\u2019s functions it is guilty of breaching federal norms. Is the States\u2019 attitude a threat to federalism? The disproportionality of the reaction of the Congress and the JDS raises a needle of suspicion. Was the Minister\u2019s Nephew a PWD Contractor to whom largesses have been given \u2013 a case of nepotism? The CM &amp; the Ministers who joined the protest need to answer these questions. The UPA made corruption a cause by holding unprecedented protest with JDS in Bengaluru on 28th March, 2019 outside the Income Tax Office.

It\u2019s time now that the journey from separate status to separatism be stopped. https://t.co/n4AxetCa9A Today, the separatists and the terrorists in the J&amp;K have been badly hit. Various developmental projects have been initiated &amp; thousands of jobs created in the State. The People of State are welcoming the socio economic changes that have taken place in the State. The govt. led by PM @narendramodi ji has decided that the rule of law in the interest of the people of Kashmir Valley &amp; the larger interest of India, must equally apply to J&amp;K. Those indulging in subversive activities in J&amp;K are dealt with in similar ways today as elsewhere. Why should rule of law that applies to the rest of country not apply to the State? Should violence, separatism, vicious ideological indoctrination be allowed that if we check it, it will have a negative effect. It is this Nehruvian policy that has proved to be counter-productive. Lakhs of Indian citizens in J&amp;K vote in Lok Sabha but not in the Assembly, Municipal or Panchayat polls. There are restrictions on State govt. jobs, owning property &amp; getting admission in the govt. institutions. Similar conditions apply to those who live elsewhere in the country. Has the Nehruvian course on which Jammu &amp; Kashmir embarked, been a historical blunder? The seven decade history of the State confronts changing India with this question. Most Indians rightly believe that erroneous Nehruvian vision has been responsible for J&amp;K\u2019s situation today. Article 35A surreptitiously inserted by Pt. Nehru\u2019s govt. in the Constitution in 1954 vide Presidential order is responsible for discrimination by the J&amp;K govt. between two categories of citizens on the basis of declaring some as permanent residents while leaving out the others.

So what is being claimed by the Congress Party - A bluff announcement. In the last 5 years, the govt. headed by PM @narendramodi introduced DBT through banks. Besides subsidies for food, fertilizer, kerosene, 55 Ministries handed over subsidies to the poor through the DBT which was enabled by AADHAAR. https://t.co/29SQfsaR2J Today most industrial workers get more than \u20b9.12,000/ month. The minimum starting salary in govt. after the 7th CPC is \u20b918,000 a month. The landless &amp; poor, amongst the villagers, get a MNREGA payment. Minimum wages for the labour have been raised by 42%. Nehruvian model stagnated growth. Indira Gandhi gave legendary slogan of \u2018Garibi Hatao\u2019 in 1971 &amp; just redistributed poverty. The legacy of poverty in India reflects inefficient governance &amp; economic model of the Congress Party. No political party has betrayed India for more than seven decades other than the Congress Party. It gave people of India slogans &amp; very little resources to implement them. However, PM @narendramodi ji has already given the poor what Congress promises.

Psychologists refer this as the Dunning-Kruger effect. This seems to be the reason which persuades the Congress President to cross the line of decency and dignity when he refers to the PM. Dynastic parties have one major drawback. If the current generation dynast is lacking in charisma, understanding &amp; popular confidence, the crowd around the family gets frustrated. The same is happening with Congress Party which is paying the price for its dynastic character. Dynasties demolish organisational structures &amp; the party becomes a crowd around the dynast. The Congress was original creator of this concept.\u00a0Ch. Charan Singh aptly said that world over parties elect leaders; in India, leaders create parties, which travel with the leader. The Congress Party has been out of power for 5 years. Its leaders &amp; workers are accustomed to existing with the frills of office. They are staring at another defeat, and the seeming reason for this is the Dynastic Character of Congress Party.

This cannot continue now. Sharing an insightful article by PM Shri @narendramodi ji. https://t.co/rLxT0i1yNx The performance of Modi govt. in the last 5 years is a fact that speaks itself loud &amp; clear, the non-performers in the past are the only critics. The World regards India as the fastest growing major economy &amp; the 130 Cr Indians believe it. Only the \u2018compulsive contrarians\u2019 don\u2019t. We are supporting farmers with over \u20b9 12 lakh crore of credit, interest subvention, subsidised crop insurance, subsidised fertiliser, seeds, increased MSP &amp; income support system. I believe these measures combined with enhanced investments will change rural India in near future. India is building 134 KM rural roads/ day, more than 10,000 KMs of National Highways/ year, with 102 functional airports, India\u2019s air traffic has seen the largest ever growth. Construction sector is growing in double digits. These facts demolish fakery that jobs are not created. The recent survey of MSME published by the CII in March 2019 indicates a growth of 13.9% in Net Jobs created over the last 4 years. The overall job additions would work out to 13.5 \u2013 14.9 million per annum. The reality of growth rejects the fake campaign of job losses in India. The period 2014-19 has witnessed the fastest ever growth of the GDP in India for a 5 year term of any government.\u00a0 It has been a period of fiscal consolidation. The comparison of present period growth with the past is undisputable. https://t.co/cytJd192ke The recent statement by the 108 purported economists reveals compulsions of \u2018Compulsive Contrarians\u2019. Most of them have, over the last few years, repeatedly signed the memorandums of manufactured issues against path breaking reforms of the present government.

We ensured that the benefit of prosperity and the first right to the exchequer going to the poor is maintained. It will be our endeavour to maintain this direction in future also. When PM @narendramodi's govt was elected, India was a part of the \u2018Fragile Five\u2019 &amp; the world was predicting that India\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 will be knocked off from the \u2018BRICS.\u2019 \u2018Reform or Perish\u2019 was a challenge &amp; the govt. committed to reforms &amp; changed the economic space of India in 5 yrs. The first NDA Govt took key decisions with regard to infrastructure creation &amp; prudent fiscal management. Bold policies on telecom &amp; National Highways made significant impacts in India. But UPA-1 &amp; 2 for their dynasty's sake strained the economy severely &amp; facilitated corruption. After 2 years of 1991 reforms which brought a directional change, the Congress Party became apologetic about the reforms. That is probably the reason why the efforts to erase the memory of P.V. Narasimha Rao from Congress\u2019s contemporary history is still a \u2018work in progress\u2019. With curb on black money, amnesty scheme, implementation of IBC, Aadhaar, Demonetisation, reigning in inflation, eliminating govt. discretions, inducing cooperative federalism, reforming Agriculture, enhancing rural &amp; urban infrastructure &amp; Ayushman Bharat, New India has emerged. Five year term is not a long period in the life of a nation. It can, however, be a turning point in its direction for progress. 1991 liberalization was an important watershed in Indian history. Similarly, 2014 govt. will be known for iconic reforms like GST &amp; Fin. inclusion etc. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part \u2013 8 : The Fourteen  Iconic Reforms of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Government  https://t.co/NmEyddMqf2 Agenda 2019, March 17, 2019  https://t.co/DoNqtqtWRU \u090f\u091c\u0947\u0902\u0921\u093e 2019, March 17, 2019 https://t.co/0ivzWhTdbl Saddened to know about the demise of senior BJP leader Shri Manohar Parrikar ji, Chief Minister of Goa.

Om Shanti \u0950 \u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f At the cusp of history, India and Indians have a choice to make. Are they electing a 6 month govt or a 5 year govt? Are they choosing between a tested &amp; performing leader or a chaotic crowd of non-leaders? I am confident aspirational people of India will make the right choice. Mahamilawat Mahagathbandhan is devoid of a common ideology or philosophy except corruption. They are rightly referred to as the \u2018Kleptocrats Club'. Temperamentally they are mavericks in the Gathbandhan, I am sure India wants stability in governance &amp; not a 6 month's experiment. The Mahamilawat Mahagathbandhan unquestionably promises political instability. Past reveals that such non-ideological alliances have only lasted for a few months. In absence of policy, this gathbandhan is a potential recipe for causing irreparable damage to India &amp; Indians. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia was the original creator of the slogan \u2018Congress Hatao Desh Bachao\u2019 while Shri Sharad Yadav sits in the Congress lap. Shri Akhilesh Yadav of Samajwadi Party appears to be more Congress than the Congress. They have buried the legacy of Dr. Lohia. The opportunism in this coalition is writ large. Sections of the Congress &amp; the AAP are talking of an alliance. AAP was formed as a reaction against the Congress corruption. Today it is kneeling down before the Congress. TDP formed as an alternative is willing to join Congress. The Mahamilawat Gathbandhan 'Mahagathbandhan' is a road to disaster. It is a race to the bottom having a tug of war on the issue of leader. Four people have clearly indicated their desire to be PM - Shri Rahul Gandhi, Behan Mayawati, Mamata Didi &amp; Shri Sharad Pawar. Constitutionally, India is a Union of States. If there is no strong Union, both India &amp; India\u2019s federalism stand to suffer. Let there be absolute clarity that India is not a Confederation of States as understood by UPA. This understanding marks the difference between NDA &amp; UPA. India cannot afford to lose opportunities at this stage. In order to move forward, India must have political stability, a clear policy direction &amp; a strong, decisive leadership. If we falter on any one of these, we will be letting our own people down &amp; damaging the future. India is today at the cusp of making history. Our revenues are growing &amp; we are finally being able to transfer more resources to the poor availing them a better quality of life. A stable central govt. is sine qua non for India to evolve into a new league in the next 2 decades. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part \u2013 7 : Mahamilawat or Gathbandhan \u2013 A Race to the Bottom    https://t.co/w9L9LCIp0w The more distasteful comment of the Congress against the Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, the greater will be the public revulsion against it. When you have no real issue against the government it is either a fakery or abuse. Fake issues raised in Rafale, Balakot, Judge Loya\u2019s death, Bank loan waiver, JNU issues, EVM, GST, demonetisation or Nirav Modi &amp; Mallya, or be it special status for Andhra Pradesh, or the issues of economy, every time fakery &amp; manufactured issues of opposition fell apart. It is unfortunate that opposition parties see opportunity in fake issues forgetting \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019. Truth holds &amp; Falsehood falls apart. The Overconfidence of opposition leaders undermining electorates\u2019 wisdom will not go unpunished in the 2019 elections. If fake issues are taken out of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s speech, nothing will perhaps be left. The Opposition underestimates the wisdom of the electorate. I am confident that the electorate will also underestimate India\u2019s Opposition parties and show them their place. It is a fair tribute to the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Government that Opposition, after 5 years, has no real issue against the Government. The Government is contesting on a pro-incumbency platform built on its performance &amp; Opposition is in a state of panic. Indian voters have a huge potential to distinguish between truth and falsehood &amp; prefer fairness. Political leaders are over-confident of their wisdom. Little do they realise that the electorate is wiser than them. Voters are capable of punishing those who resort to falsehood. Rahul Gandhi has led not only his party but the entire Opposition to rely on fake and manufactured issues. They raise fake issues, create an echo effect and then believe their falsehood to be true. It\u2019s time that they come out of the cocoon of falsehood or perish there. The NDA govt. is led by a leader with whom the comfort level of the voter is high. The Opposition is in a state of panic.  It\u2019s single point programme is a negative one - \u2018remove one man\u2019. The level of their ambition is limited. The real strength of Indian democracy is the inherent wisdom of the voters. They punish non-performers and they vote back those who deliver. Pollsters, political pandits and commentators usually go wrong. Poll campaigners must know that \u201ca campaign of fake issues never works\u201d. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part \u2013 6 : A Campaign of Fake Issues Never Works   https://t.co/2clwUbyHft 2014 LS elections echoed realisations of aspirational India that it is only men of merit, competence &amp; integrity matter &amp; not the membership of a family. I am confident that this trend will continue in the 2019 elections. PM Modi &amp; New India will together demolish the dynasties. The real strength of democracy will be realised when myth of dynasties is finally buried and these parties are taken over by men of competence and merit. That will provide Indians with a choice. The impact of such parties on politics, policy &amp; governance has been quite adverse coupled with their capacity to make a difference in the arithmetic of coalition politics. Family owned parties compromise ethics in public life, leading to fall in ethical standards of governance. Many of the leaders of such dynastic parties are highly corrupt &amp; their survival is the main political agenda of the party. Even in prison, their stranglehold on the cadres remains. If dynasts defect from one coalition to another, the cadres call it an opportunity. In the changed Indian political scenario, the dynastic parties' cadres owed loyalty only to the charismatic leader. In most cases the leader amassed wealth &amp; the party functioned like a personal property of the family &amp; the Party became a crowd around the dynastic family. The Congress tried to remove itself from the dynasty's shackles for a brief period after the unfortunate assassination of Sh. Rajiv Gandhi. However, very soon Smt.Sonia Gandhi took over as longest serving President of the Party, &amp; finally passing the baton to her son Rahul Gandhi The seeds to convert India into a dynastic democracy were sown by Pt. Nehru who ignored a galaxy of tall national leaders of the Congress Party &amp; started grooming his daughter Smt. Indira Gandhi as his successor. He made her the Congress President ahead of many other seniors. How does the world\u2019s largest democracy elect its govt.? Should it be on the basis of leadership quality, policy, ideology, performance or on the basis of dynasties &amp; family charismas? I am sure, PM Modi &amp; aspirational India will prevent India from becoming a dynastic democracy. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part \u2013 5 : Prime Minister Modi and Aspirational India Will Prevent India From Becoming a Dynastic Democracy.   https://t.co/IavaOYbssi The salient point that distinguishes Modi govt. has been its motivation &amp; leadership. It is precisely for this reason that India will witness an election where the people will get an opportunity to endorse PM Modi\u2019s leadership &amp; performance of last 5 yrs. 'Modi Hai to Mumkin Hai' India's stand against terrorism has earned it international support &amp; with the Surgical Strikes of 2016 &amp; Air Strikes of 2019, it has been demonstrated that India is willing to adopt unconventional methods of attacking terror at the point of its origin. This evolves New India. On social inclusion, for the first time, a 10% reservation for the economically weaker sections of non-reserved categories has been given in public employment &amp; educational institutions. The socio-economic policies of Modi govt. in the last 5 yrs  have benefitted every Indian. In a historic move to benefit unorganised sector labour, including farmers, the Modi govt. has now ensured Rs.3000 pension where the Government contributes 50%. Direct income support to farmers of Rs 6000 per year is another historic action of the govt led by @narendramodi ji. From rural sanitation &amp; roads to highways, Ujjwala scheme, ensuring healthcare to millions of Indians through Ayushman Bharat, financial inclusion of crores of people through PMJDY, to facilitating crores of self-employment by Mudra Yojana have shown a turnaround in last 5 years India has been the fastest growing major economy in the world for the last 5 years in a row. This has been achieved without any increase in direct or indirect taxes. With GST being continuously moderated &amp; made compliance friendly, it has benefitted SMEs &amp; millions of people. Inspired by the indefatigable approach of PM @narendramodi ji towards the people of India, the BJP slogan for the forthcoming elections \u201cModi Hai to Mumkin Hai\u201d \u2013 \u2018Modi makes it possible\u2019, lives up to the expectations of New India. Prime Minister @narendramodi has demonstrated during the last 5 years his indefatigability towards making of New India, a power to reckon with. Many India observers across the world have marvelled with India\u2019s pace of decision making &amp; implementation. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part - 4 : Modi Hai To Mumkin Hai    https://t.co/Wh4U7hJuHB Will the Congress President tell us who the original sinner was? ..We cannot, of course, accept this as it means falling out with China and it would be very unfair for a great country like China not to be in the Security Council.\u201d Pt. Nehru\u2019s infamous letter to Chief Ministers\u2019 dated August 2, 1955 states \u201cInformally, suggestions have been made by the United States that China should be taken into the United Nations but not in the Security Council, &amp; that India should take her place in the Security Council. The original mistake, both on Kashmir and China, was committed by the same person. The message today to those who operated improperly in the system is clear now, \u2018it is safer to be fair\u2019.  This marks the difference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s NDA Government and its predecessor UPA Governments. The former PM late Shri Rajiv Gandhi had stated that only 15% of the amount released by the Central Govt reaches the beneficiaries. Corruption accounts for the balance 85%. Modi Govt. ensured that\npayments reach the bank of the beneficiary straightway without middlemen. For the first time, we have had a Govt. for 5 years which has not increased any taxes. On the contrary, it has reduced many &amp; yet significantly increased the tax base &amp; the tax collections. This has enabled greater spending for defence, poverty alleviation and infrastructure. The message is clear-this Govt. works &amp; we have lived upto the promise of PM Modi. Be it Banks or any other Dept, processes have been made online, transparent &amp; rent free. It is not without reason that India\u2019s Ease of Doing Business ratings have improved from a horrible\n142 to 77 Prior to May 2014, corridors of North Block &amp; Udyog Bhawan used to be flooded with businessman &amp; industrialists, are today vacant. Because in Modi govt. files are not pushed but decided on merit &amp; in national interest. Once at the helm these middlemen have been rendered jobless. Under Modi govt. a \u2018new normal\u2019 has now been established in India. If\nyou don\u2019t pay back the banks, you will be out of management. If you escape out of the country, you will be extradited back. If you indulge\nin round-tripping, you will be found out &amp; punished. Frustrated with the honest work &amp; clean image of PM Modi &amp; his govt., the Congress leaders tried fake allegations but were snubbed both by the Courts &amp; the CAG. There is a message loud and clear to all, \u201conly honesty prevails nothing else\u201d. From the Bofors gun deal to the HDW Submarine purchases, the Airbus\ntransaction, the Augusta Westland deal, to the fertilizer scam, the footprints of the Indian National Congress and its leaders were everywhere. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s 5 year tenure will be regarded by future\nhistorians as a time point where a movement to free India from\ncorruption began. The Government and its Ministers have conclusively\nproved that it is possible to run an honest government in India. India\u2019s credibility on issues of corruption touched rock bottom before\n2014. Banking system had been severely damaged by those who benefitted\nfrom \u2018phone banking\u2019. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s first 5 year tenure proved\nto be a turning point against corruption in all forms. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part - 3 : Is Prime Minister Modi\u2019s First Five Year Tenure a Turning Point on Corruption?  https://t.co/4nLYSb0lfq Unhesitatingly the answer to the above question is a big \u2018yes\u2019.  This country is safe and secure under the NDA Government led by Prime Minister Modi. Can those who have weakened the battle against terror for the cause of vote bank politics be trusted?  Should not those who have played into the Pakistani hands be taught a severe lesson in these elections? The battle against terror has been weakened on account of Congress party and its 'mahagathbandhan' friends diluting the fight against terror &amp; insurgency for the sake of votes. Congress had no structured plan during 10 years of UPA on how to deal with terrorism problem in J&amp;K. Congress President Rahul Gandhi stood shoulder to shoulder with 'tukde tukde gang' to defend their right of free speech to champion the cause of breaking India into pieces. He deviated from the Congress legacy of not associating with these extremists. The entire nation in one voice has condemned terrorism which cost us the life of two of our former PMs, besides our security personnel &amp; citizens. However, the Congress party\u2019s attitude towards separatism &amp; terror reached low point when it supported \u2018Desh ke tukde tukde\u2019 slogans. JeM terrorist attack at Pulwama has brought back into focus the key issue of national security. Prime Minister Modi\u2019s evolving national security doctrine has ensured that India is tough on terrorist and those sheltering and using them against India. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part - 2 : Prime Minister Modi\u2019s Evolving National Security Doctrine    https://t.co/pU8aqvC9I5 The leadership issue is an absolute puzzle. The \u2018Mahagathbandhan\u2019 alliance will not have a stable nucleus. It has a set of highly ambitious, self-centered and maverick leaders. \u200bThe contest is between a trusted leader in whose hand the country is secure &amp; an unprojected leader. However \u2018Mahagathbandhan\u2019 is turning out to be a \u2018gathbandhan\u2019 of several conflicting gathbandhans. It is a self-destructive \u2018coalition of rivals\u2019. BSP &amp; SP will contest against the Congress but eventually join hands. So will the Trinamool &amp; the Congress-Left alliance in WB. Within the NDA there are no leadership issues.  There is absolute clarity.  Shri Narendra Modi leads the NDA and will be the Prime Minister in the event of the NDA victory.  His leadership is nationally accepted, his ratings are very high.  His track record speaks for itself. As PM of India he proved to the world that India can be administered with honesty and integrity. India is capable of tough decisions in order to ensure growth and enable India to secure itself. India occupies the high table in the world today. The country has assessed Sh Narendra Modi as Gujarat CM for 14 years. He communicates directly with the people &amp; stands out as a communicator. He entered the 2014 electoral race when the country saw indecisiveness &amp; a collapse of leadership. People gave him a comfortable mandate. Anti-incumbency is a phenomenon &amp; opposition succeeds by default. However, if the comfort level &amp; the confidence in incumbent is high, his leadership, performance, ethics &amp; integrity has been tested, the incumbent succeeds phenomenally in the elections. With the announcement of 2019 LS elections schedule, the next 10 weeks will witness a clash of ideas &amp; ideologies and a battle for leadership. One of the principal issues for 2019 elections is the issue of leadership. Agenda 2019 \u2013 Part - I : The Leadership Issue   https://t.co/rHBhmuBD1q Sharing my interaction with @RajatSharmaLive in the #AapKiAdalat program, March 9, 2019 https://t.co/YvUhT3e3Pw Watch me on India TV #AapKiAdalat with @RajatSharmaLive at 10 PM tonight (March 9, 2019) https://t.co/lEoJzG1McI Releasing the book 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas', New Delhi, March 8, 2019 https://t.co/xAwXLDZEmq Sharing my speech at the release of the book 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas', March 8, 2019 https://t.co/Uk88095m3d I convey my best wishes to Smt. Vasundhara Raje ji on her birthday. May God bless her with a long, healthy &amp; successful life. @VasundharaBJP #internationalwomensday greetings to all https://t.co/UNnnRstoN6 Total number of small and marginal Farmers forwarded by some states are as follows: https://t.co/lLk3hXDDxQ However, the spread of beneficiaries is very uneven across states.  Why are some Congress ruled states and West Bengal not co-operating with PM-Kisan?  Why are they letting down their farmers? Union Government has released the first instalment of Rs.2000 to \nmore than 2 crore small and marginal farmers under #PM-KISAN Scheme within 11 days of the launch of the scheme. The Government, in 2015, had released a new series of banknotes which incorporated Braille like signs for the benefit of visually impaired persons. The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, released the new series  Rs.1, Rs.2, Rs.5, Rs.10 and Rs.20 coins. These coins contain design features which will be of great assistance to visually impaired persons. The attack on innocent Kashmiris is condemnable. Our fight is against the separatists and terrorists. We need the people of Jammu and Kashmir with us in the fight against terror. The grenade attack in Jammu is condemnable.  I wish the injured a speedy recovery. Briefing media on the decisions of the Union Cabinet, March 7, 2019 https://t.co/lD7SkCSyBZ A national survey, conducted by an Independent Agency under the World Bank support to #SwachBharatMission, has found that 93.4% of households in rural India who have access to toilet use it, showing that construction is also matched by a behavioural change in the usage of toilets Over 9.23 crore toilets have been constructed under the #SwachBharatMission, taking the coverage of toilets from 39% in October, 2014 to 98.9% as on date. 30 States/UTs have become open defecation free. In just over 5 months of its launch #AyushmanBharat #PMJAY is well on its way to become the world\u2019s largest free healthcare scheme with \u2013  2.2 crore people issued e-cards and  over 14 lakh people treated. Income Tax Exemption for Gratuity under Section 10(10)(iii) of the Income Tax Act has been enhanced to Rs. 20 lakh.

I hope, India\u2019s Opposition revisits its position and does not let down the nation. In his speech Dr Singh implicitly doubted India\u2019s right to defend its sovereignty from those who want to damage it through terrorism. He mentioned poverty, ignorance and disease in his speech. But violence and terrorism are of no consequence in his assessment. The most disappointing &amp; objectionable statement was of the former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. He stated that he was disturbed with the \u201cMad rush of mutual self-destruction\u201d by the two nations. According to him perpetrator of terrorism &amp; its victim are both at par. The West Bengal Chief Minister went a step further. She started doubting the veracity of the incident and wanted to know the operational details. The credibility of both the Government and our Air Force is being doubted. Even Congress leaders have raised similar questions. The resolution passed by 21 Opposition Parties after their meeting accusing the Prime Minister of politicizing the Pulwama &amp; Balakot incidents was highly inappropriate. It gave a handle to the enemy. Pakistan's media used this statement of 21 Opposition Parties as a trump card. These statements made by opposition parties hurt India\u2019s national interest. They give smiles to Pakistan and become an instrument in Pakistan\u2019s hands to discredit India's operation against terrorism. After IAF's counter terror operation in Balakot, three statements ought not to have been made by India's opposition parties. When entire nation was speaking in one voice &amp; standing by the armed forces.

A war memorial of India which is a tribute to our war heroes is a significant point in our history of India. Chaired the 33rd meeting of GST Council in Delhi, February 24, 2019 https://t.co/aj573qQ7fP In its 33rd meeting the GST Council has accorded big relief to Real Estate Sector. GST rate on affordable housing has been reduced to 1% from 8% &amp; for others from 12% to 5% for both without ITC.This will give boost to housing for all &amp; fulfill aspirations of Neo/Middle classes. *Sharing my speech at ET-Global Business Summit 2019, 22 February 2019. #ETGBS  https://t.co/tDeReOf7Ry* Ordinary patriotic Indians who do not have the benefit of strategic inputs as would be available to Congress Party now, would also know the response on the above points. I am sure there would be many serious inputs relating to the security strategy that experts would give to the Congress Party along with that to serve petty political gains, do not politicise defence procurement on false and imaginary facts.  It hurts defence preparedness. When our intelligence agencies conduct anti-insurgency operations along with the security forces (e.g. Ishrat Jahan case), do not let lose investigative agencies on the intelligence and security network of India. When security personnel fight the terrorists and make sacrifices (e.g. Batla House), do not legitimise terrorism by standing shoulder to shoulder with the terrorists and call the war against terror as a fake encounter. Politicians of any shade of opinion should not get into slanging match with any of the services personnel or their Chief.  The Chief of a Force can\u2019t be described as a \u2018Sadak ka Goonda\u2019. Do not encourage indiscriminate illegal immigration into India &amp; block steps which are taken to stop it. It hurts national security. Our Armed forces are amongst the most professional organisations &amp;  which have served this country exceedingly well. Do not trivialise a serious national concern on terrorism as has been done by the Congress Spokespersons in the past two days. Next time if extremists &amp; separatists raise slogans on how to break India (JNU incident), no one from mainstream parties should pay a supporting visit. Do not give an impression to the world that India is divided on how to fight terrorism.  When the world is rallying around India, the Opposition in India should not be striking a discordant note. It is intriguing that the Party which has ruled the country for over half a century should need to be educated on national security concerns. I am sure amongst the various advices that experts will render to the Congress President on strategic issues, a few would be essential. The appointment of General Hooda is significant.  It is a belated &amp; grudging recognition &amp; acceptance of the surgical strikes of 2016 with which the General was intrinsically associated.  I am sure he would educate the Party leaders that the surgical strikes were no routine step. Congress President announced appointment of Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda (Retd.), a distinguished fmr officer of Indian Army &amp; a committee headed by him to advice the Party on National Security Policy. I have not the least doubt that he would give valuable advice to the grand old Party.

Birthday compliments to Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet, may she be blessed with good health and a long life. @SushmaSwaraj The lies of \u2018Mahajhootbandhan\u2019 stand exposed by the CAG Report. How does democracy punish those who consistently lied to the nation? It cannot be that the Supreme Court is wrong, the CAG is wrong and only the dynast is right. 2016 vs. 2007 terms \u2013 Lower price, faster delivery, better maintenance, lower escalation. Satyameva Jayate\u201d \u2013 the truth shall prevail.  The CAG Report on Rafale reaffirms the dictum. Now without a shred of evidence, a fictional conflict of interest of the CAG is invented. How many more lies will be peddled to sustain a sinking dynast?  India, certainly deserves better. The use of an incomplete document is certainly not in consonance with the spirit of free speech. The \u2018no integrity pact\u2019 argument is belied by the fact that even in earlier purchases through inter-governmental agreement with Russia and the United States, such pacts were not there The procedure argument that there was no Defence Acquisition Council, no CCS, no Contract Negotiation Committee was a blatant lie. The dynast and his friends have in the past even attacked the Supreme Court when it rejected the writ petition on Rafale.  The entire pricing argument was factually wrong. I say this without fear of contradiction that no file or paper relating to the Rafale transaction ever reached him nor was he in any way, directly or indirectly, associated with the decision making on defence purchases. In relation to the Rafale deal where thousands of crores of public money has been saved, a new falsehood is manufactured on a daily basis. The latest is in relation to the present CAG and his participation in the decision making process of Rafale. How many lies are necessary to be peddled to save a sinking dynasty?  The contagion effect of falsehood is fairly large.  It appears to have spread to other colleagues in the \u2018Mahajhootbandhan\u2019. The \u2018slave\u2019 mentality of senior leaders of Congress Party convinces them that they must only sing the song scripted by the dynast.  A contrarian opinion will cost them their political career.  When the dynast speaks lies, they all join the chorus. In modern world dynasties inherently have their limitations. Aspirational societies abhor kingdoms. They insist on accountability and performance. But the grand old party of Indian politics has sadly become a captive of a dynasty. In mature democracies those who deliberately rely on falsehood are banished from public life. With the changing socio-economic profile of India this will inevitably happen in India. Whatever be the number of peddled lies it can not  to sustain a sinking dynasty. How Many Lies Need to be Peddled to Sustain a Sinking Dynasty?    https://t.co/EQk6VqSUQT \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928 \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0915, \u0926\u0947\u0936\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u0935 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0938\u092e\u093e\u091c \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092a\u0915 \u092e\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0940 #\u0926\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u092f\u0902\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u092e\u0928\u0964 https://t.co/gFIsdeFte1 Secretary (Economic affairs) has no role in expenditure files of the Defence ministry. Defence ministry files are dealt with by Secretary (Expenditure). After ten years in Government former UPA ministers still don\u2019t know that Finance Secretary is only a designation given to the senior most secretary in the finance ministry. Another attack on the institution of GAG by the \u2018Institution wreckers\u2019 based on falsehood. It is about time that India and its institutions are protected from these \u2018institution wreckers\u2019. History will record that Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s great grandson has singularly damaged India\u2019s Parliament as an institution more than anyone else. The Congress aligned with the Maoist in the recent Chhattisgarh elections.  Rahul Gandhi stood shoulder to shoulder with the \u2018Tukde Tukde\u2019 gang at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.  The Congress was in the forefront of defending the urban naxals in court. It slaughters a cow before the cameras in Kerala, and invokes the National Security Act against the cow killers in Madhya Pradesh.    More than any institution it is the country whose interest is paramount. In West Bengal, democracy is seriously under peril.  BJP leaders can\u2019t land, public meetings are being prevented and the Rath Yatra was disallowed.  The Congress Party\u2019s stand on multiple issues is self-contradictory. They criticise the Government the maximum and simultaneously argue that the free speech is in danger.   They shed crocodile tears for democracy and make every effort to convert the world\u2019s largest democracy into a dynastic one. The Government does not interfere in any investigative function of CBI or any other investigative agency. In fact, it is the Opposition which has maintained a two-way approach to the CBI - on a daily basis the CBI should be attacked when it investigates corruption cases. The Government is the principal manager of the nation\u2019s economy.  How can raising legitimate issues relating to credit and liquidity availability be an interference with the RBI. The Govt. &amp; the BJP have consistently stood by our Armed Forces. It is the Opposition which questioned first the existence of the surgical strike and then played it down as a routine action which has also taken place in the past &amp; described Army Chief was as a \u2018Sadak ka Gunda'. The attack on EVM\u2019s is not merely to allay defeat, it is an attack on the Election Commission. The EVM were introduced into the election process when BJP was nowhere close to power. Multiple parties have won &amp; lost elections held through the EVM. Why attack EVM without evidence. The impeachment motion filed by the Opposition on unsustainable grounds was only an attempt to intimidate the then Chief Justice of India &amp; set an example for other judges - you toe our line or we can create an embarrassing situation for you. That was the loud and clear message. One of the key points being made in regard to the judiciary is that the Govt. referred back one of the recommendations to the SC to the collegium for reconsideration. It is visible that in the last 5 years have seen more appointments each year than done in any of the UPA years. If we analyse Rahul Gandhi\u2019s two speeches on Rafale, they are based on a personal hatred for the Prime Minister emanating from envy. A failed student always hates the class topper. The attack has now shifted to a new ground. Institutions are under pressure\u2013the charge comes from none other than those who have a history of having subverted institutions all their lives. Illustratively little did they realise that PMLAs harsh provisions could haunt them one day The campaign against the GST fizzled out since in just eighteen months of implementation it became a consumer friendly measure reducing taxes, exempting small businesses and ending corruption/ harassment by eliminating interface of the assessee and the officials. The falsehood that the Government and its Ministers were colluding to allow the economic offenders to escape was exposed when one after the other the investigative agencies were succeeding in bringing back many of the key defaulters and middlemen. Those who organised loot on the banks between 2008-2014, started alleging that industrial loans had been waived. Not a single rupee was waived. On the contrary, the defaulters have been thrown out of management &amp; Congress's falsehood was exposed. The Rafale deal not only strengthens the combat ability of the Indian Air Force but saved thousands of crores for the exchequer. When its falsehood collapsed, its creators by producing half a document lost their full credibility. They forgot that truth always prevails. The past two months have witnessed several fake campaigns.  Each one of them has failed to cut much ice.  Falsehood doesn\u2019t have longevity.  The \u2018compulsive contrarians\u2019 continued to jump from one falsehood to another. \u201cInstitutions Under Attack\u201d \u2013 The Latest Fabrication    https://t.co/cM6kVhPi6P On the auspicious occasion of  #BasantPanchami greetings to everyone.\n\u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u094b #\u092c\u0938\u0902\u0924\u092a\u0902\u091a\u092e\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902 \u0964 https://t.co/0lajGRGZd8 Delighted to be back home. Votes are important, so is fairness. Political opportunists only look at the next day\u2019s Headlines. Nation-builders look at the next Century. Unfortunately, when human conscience should have been repelled while reading this news in the morning Newspapers. The AICC President Rahul Gandhi and his coterie, while addressing a minority convention promised to withdraw the Bill pending in the Parliament. The Supreme Court has already declared instant talaq as unconstitutional and yet in the absence of a deterrent it can at best amount to a civil wrong with no penal consequences. A number of Muslim men and conservatives are choosing to even ignore the Supreme Court judgment. Some incidents are so unconscionable and repulsive that they shake the conscience of the society and compel it to take remedial measures. Injustice perpetuated by personal laws is a glaring example of this. On both occasions, she was sedated and asked to undergo, Nikah-halala, on the first occasion with her father-in-law and on the subsequent occasion with her brother-in-law. They both raped her. A recent case from Bareilly has shocked my conscience. It relates to the obnoxious practice of Nikah-halala in Islamic personal law. A lady who is married in 2009 was twice divorced by her husband through Triple Talaq, once in 2011 and subsequently in 2017. Does the Bareilly \u201cNikah-Halala\u201d not shock your conscience?   https://t.co/VJsPsZAQk4 Truth has an inherent strength. It demolishes a false narrative easily. This is what the PM did today. @narendramodi Will the Congress and other Opposition Leader\u2019s reply to the data in the PM\u2019s Speech or only resort to slogans and falsehood. @narendramodi Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reply in Parliament is a Report Card of the Government\u2019s Five Year Performance. @narendramodi More importantly those who have lent support to the West Bengal Dharna are those who are battling serious allegations of economic improprieties, criminal misconduct and even corruption. Can \u201cNew India\u201d be ever run by this Kleptocrat\u2019s Club? 2019 Election will be either Modi Vs. Chaos or Modi Vs. Anarchy. Mamata Banerjee\u2019s latest acrobatics are the best evidence of the kind of governance India\u2019s opposition can provide. Curiously, the AICC President somersaulted his position from Saradha being a scam to \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201dsupport to scamster. Interestingly, the first family of Congress where most members are on bail. A non-ideological short-lived coalition of opposition is disaster for India. When Mamata Banerjee decided to sit on a Dharna she received support of many opposition parties who  aspire to be in power. Most of them, or their affiliates are today being investigated, prosecuted and in some cases have also been convicted for crimes of corruption. Today the CBI is being brutally prevented by physical force and detention of its officer from investigating a crime legally within its jurisdiction, in the State of West Bengal. It is a textbook illustration of a State Government assaulting Federalism. It would be a gross error to assume that she did this because of a routine investigation involving a Police Officer. She did it to defocus from other opposition aspirants for the highest office and to project herself as the nucleus of India\u2019s opposition. Mamata Banerjee\u2019s disproportionate over-reaction to the CBI wanting to interrogate the Kolkata Police Chief has flagged several issues for a public discourse. The most important being that a Kleptocrat\u2019s Club now aspires to capture the reigns of India. The Kleptocrat\u2019s Club   https://t.co/c4VfU3DuYZ Modi Government clears one more step to get Mallya extradited while Opposition rallies around the Saradha Scamsters. Sh. Kharge is part of a Collegium that discharges a governance function. The position of Sh Kharge as the LOP in the Lok Sabha, entitles him to sit in the Committee but the political colour of that office has to be left outside, unfortunately, that does not seem to have happened. The only thing constant in the High Powered Committee comprising of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of the Opposition which deals with the CBI Director\u2019s appointment and transfer, is the Kharge dissent. Sh. Kharge\u2019s dissent in the matter of the transfer of Alok Verma was coloured by his political views. He was a petitioner in the Supreme Court himself in support of Alok Verma. He should have recused himself from the Committee since his views were known A dissenter challenges the majority. He does it on the basis of a call of conscience dictated by his fair mind. He puts his dissent on record so that it can be of value to the wisdom of the future generations. A dissent should never be a political tool. Sh. Kharge dissents regularly. He dissented when Shri Alok Verma was appointed, dissented when Shri Alok Verma was transferred and has now dissented when Shri R. K. Shukla has been appointed. Shri Kharge has dissented a bit too frequently. Many may wonder if Collegium\u2019s are workable. The appointment of a CBI Director was never envisaged to be a political battle. Shri Kharge has made it look like one. Has Mr. Kharge Brought Down the Value of Dissent?    https://t.co/EU76AMXfz8 Sharing my interview on Union Budget 2019-20, February 1, 2019 https://t.co/HhkRXLqyIT Higher direct and indirect tax collections in 2016-17 and 2017-18 are an indicator of high growth in those two years. Growth is based on estimates, but tax collections are real. If there is no job creation, as alleged, there should have logically been a great social unrest in the country. Past five years have passed off without a single major protest movement. Last year the Government restored the benefit of Standard Deduction to salaried taxpayer at Rs.40,000/-. This year this benefit is being extended to Rs.50,000/-. In a further calibrated move, those in the income bracket of Rs.3 to 5 lakhs witnessed their tax liability being halved from 10% to 5% and today this category has been completely exempted. The tax exemption limit was first raised from Rs. 2 lakhs to Rs. 2.5 lakhs by the NDA Government. Thereafter, without altering the slabs, people earning upto Rs. 3 lakhs were exempted from payment of taxes. In another step towards farmers' welfare, the Budget has announced today a significant income support scheme for every eligible land owning family involved in agriculture who will now be entitled to a sum of Rs. 6,000/- annually. GST has already brought down most taxes on goods from 31% tax to the 18%, 12% and the 5% bracket. Never in the history of India during the five year tenure of a Government we have witnessed tax reduction and a Middle Class relief of this magnitude. The future vision is to make India a Five Trillion Dollar economy. By the middle of the next decade we will achieve this and thereafter, target doubling that size of the economy. The economic reforms undertaken by the NDA Government have unshackled Indian economy, unleashed its potential and made us a global leader in growth. The Interim Budget (2019) and a five year direction   https://t.co/xWL5KjRwcl Between 2014-19, every Budget has given significant relief to the Middle Class. The Budget is unquestionably Pro-Growth, Fiscally prudent, Pro-Farmer, Pro-Poor and strengthens the purchasing power of the Indian Middle Class. The Budget expands spending while pragmatically sticking to fiscal prudence. My compliments to Shri Piyush Goyal for delivering an excellent Budget. The Budget furthers the agenda of the Government headed by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji to comprehensively address the challenges of the economy. @PiyushGoyal Interim Budgets are also an opportunity for the Government of the day to introspect their performance of the last five years and place its facts before the people. The Interim Budget presented by Shri Piyush Goyal today marks a high point in the policy directions that the Government headed by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given to this nation. @narendramodi @PiyushGoyal If the Prime Minister is honest, if he imposes a culture of honesty in governance, no person who cheats India will escape. The UPA Skeletons are tumbling out by the day. Why did all Defence purchases need middlemen? No one who cheats INDIA can hide anywhere in the world and escape. INDIA\u2019s Diplomatic strength and more civilized International procedures will get better of him. Congratulations to @PiyushGoyal on receiving the prestigious Carnot Prize, for distinguished contributions to energy policy. His excellent contribution is being recognised internationally.  #Carnotprize In the post Lohia era, with the emergence of the BJP as the principal pole of Indian politics, many Lohiaites shed their inhibition &amp; started political business with Congress. The Left was not far behind. They called it re-polarisation. One hon\u2019ble exception was George Fernandes. After the 1962 General Elections and the China war debacle, Dr. Lohia gave to this country the famous slogan \u201cCongress hatao desh bachao\u201d. This led to an anti-Congress alliance. George Fernandes was the last of the veteran Lohiaites. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, George Saheb\u2019s mentor represented the anti-Nehru, anti-Congress face of Indian politics. While in the opposition, George spent the rest of his next decade in opposition championing the issues of the farmers, Trade Unions and finally Bofors. He was one of the leading campaigners against corruption in the Rajiv Gandhi era. Yet twice as a Defence Minister, false allegations of corruption were leveled against him. A Commission of Enquiry in the Tehelka Tape issue vindicated George. The Coffingate Report was an absurdity. In the NDA Government, headed by Mr. Vajpayee, George as the Convenor of the NDA was one of the architects of alliance formation. Even his worst critics would not attempt to level allegations of corruption against him. Nobody believed that Patil could ever be defeated, till a 36 year old President of the Bombay Taxi Union, George Fernandes, announced that he would challenge Patil in the elections &amp; finally Patil lost election. George saheb once narrated to me his story, the entire tale of 1967 South-Bombay elections. That election would be an education for any student of psephology or electoral politics. George Fernandes, the veteran socialist leader, was a politician with a difference, with his passing away India has lost a political colossus. In the early 70s, when I was a student, George was one of the most charismatic speakers, much wanted to address campus audiences. George Saheb as I knew him   https://t.co/5QEH5ecKff I convey my best wishes to ministerial colleague Shri Prakash Javadekar ji on his birthday. May God bless him with good health, and a long life. @PrakashJavdekar On Punya Tithi of Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, we remember his life and ideals and pay him our respectful tributes. Gandhi ji, always remained an inspiration for people globally to follow right path, the path of nonviolence in all their actions. His parliamentary career spanned many decades and his speeches delivered in the house and outside had immediate connect with the people. He guided many ministries as Union Minister &amp; contributed immensely to nation building. The nation will miss George Saheb. Extremely pained to know about the passing away of Shri George Fernandes, a veteran politician, an exceptional socialist in vision and action, &amp; a nationalist to the core. Condolences to bereaved family, friends &amp; admirers. May the departed soul rest in peace. Warm birthday greetings to Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers.

Happy 70th #RepublicDay2019 https://t.co/TmekQpaZNW Delighted to know the conferment of  Bharat Ratna on Nanaji Deshmukh, an icon of socio rural development &amp; self independence in true sense. Heartiest compliments to Pranab Da &amp; Shri Bhupen Hazarika ji on being conferred upon country\u2019s highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna. My advice to our investigators \u2013 avoid adventurism and follow the advice given to Arjun in the Mahabharata \u2013 Just concentrate on the bulls eye. Professional investigation targets the guilty &amp; protects the innocent. It secures convictions and furthers public interest. One of the reasons why our conviction rates are poor is that adventurism and megalomania overtakes our investigators and professionalism takes a back seat. Professional investigation targets the real accused on the basis of actual and admissible evidences. It rules out fanciful presumptions. There is no personal malice or corruption. It targets the guilty and protects the innocent. Sitting thousands of kilometers away, when I read the list of potential targets in the ICICI case, the thought that crossed my mind was again the same \u2013 Instead of focusing primarily  on the target, it is a journey to no where (everywhere). Investigative Adventurism Vs. Professional Investigation   https://t.co/FUhJh5Ws29 The upholding of the provisions that bar the defaulting promoters from bidding is both ethical and proper \u2013 otherwise the defaulter will continue to manage the company with only the banks taking a haircut. The Supreme Court judgment upholding the validity of the IBC is a welcome decision. The Bank defaulters cannot get away for long. On Jayanti of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a great freedom fighter, nationalist and a charismatic leader, we remember his life and works and pay him our respectful tributes. His life will always remain an inspiration for patriotism and Indian nationalism. I bow to Netaji. Does the Congress feel that the people are so gullible that they will swallow any garbage?\nInsanity in the Congress party is increasingly becoming contagious Was the Election Commission &amp; millions of Staffers involved in manufacturing, programming of EVMs &amp; conduct of elections during the UPA Government in collusion with the BJP \u2013 absolutely rubbish. After Rafale, the non-existent loan waiver to 15 industrialists \u2013 the next big lie \u2013 EVM hacking. People are more intelligent than what politicians may think. They never choose chaos as an option. Aspirational society never commits collective suicide as they do not suffer from a Lemming Syndrome. People want a 5 Year Government, not a 6 Month one. The NDA has to be prepared for a battle for a 50% vote in the direct fight contest. Many States will still witness triangular contests. If a second term for Prime Minister Modi is the issue, it is advantage BJP. The election will be more presidential. It is obvious that the level of satisfaction with PM Sh. @narendramodi ji is very high. If that weren\u2019t so, what was the need for multiple disparate forces to come together against him? It is only the fear of his popularity &amp; a certain comeback that is bringing them together. Kolkata rally which was basically an anti-Modi rally, became significantly a non-Rahul Gandhi rally, by his conspicuous absence. All four ambitious politicians pursue fanciful strategies to replace PM @narendramodi, however, Congress can at best dream only to be a pillion rider. Opposition politics has thrown up four desirous Prime Ministers wishing to challenge PM Shri @narendramodi ji. Every General Election has its own script that is dictated by the prevailing political environment. For 2019 political battle, India\u2019s opposition has a two-fold strategy, firstly, negative anti-Modi agenda &amp;secondly,random political grouping to gain from the electoral arithmetic. Agenda for 2019 \u2013 Modi Vs. Chaos   https://t.co/8tbsefKvjD Fudged arithmetics does not add to the credibility of its creator. The Supreme Court has examined the prices. The CAG is examining the same. The fudged arithmetic of a compulsive contrarian can hardly be objective. The 2007 escalation offer was much larger than 2016 agreed escalation. The price differential would widen with  each subsequent supply. The new Article on Rafale is based on fudged arithmetic - ignore the escalation of the 2007 non-deal offer and compare it with the 2016 price and invent a scam. Addressing the 14th edition of the \u2018India Business Leaders Awards\u2019 (IBLA) hosted by CNBC-TV18 via video conferencing https://t.co/JBpk1KjSsV I have highlighted many examples of Compulsive Contrarians in my blog. Free speech &amp; the right to dissent are critical components of a democracy but falsehood, subversion and institutional destruction are not. These actions reveal the mindset of the Compulsive Contrarians. These Compulsive Contrarians picked holes in every proposal that empowered people or strengthened country, be it 10% reservation for the poor, AADHAAR, Demonetisation, GST, CBI issues, RBI &amp; Govt. relation, Rafale fighter aircraft, or no issues in Supreme Court or Judge Loya case There are some in the political system who thought that they were born to rule. Some who were part of the ideological left &amp; the ultra-left obviously found the NDA Govt. wholly unacceptable. Hence emerged a new class of Compulsive Contrarians, who run perpetual propaganda. The Compulsive Contrarian and his Manufactured Logic   https://t.co/BP0fZO1hz8 Saddened to know about the passing away of Shri Vishnu Hari Dalmia ji, former VHP president &amp; a great leader. His contributions to society will always be remembered. My condolences to the bereaved family members. May God render peace to the departed soul. India today is the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Still we are not satisfied with a 7 to 7.5% growth rate. Soon India will break the 8% barrier. Ease of Doing Business Ranking in 5 years has improved from 142nd position to 77th. With targeted transfer of resources to rural India in the past 5 years, a huge aspirational class is emerging even in the rural areas. This is an indication of what the social profile, purchasing power and the quality of life Indians are going to have. The McKinsey Institute reports that the size of India\u2019s middle-class is growing very fast from 14% in 2005 to 29% in 2015 &amp; by 2025 it would be 44%. India\u2019s fiscal discipline during the past 5 years has been amongst the best as compared to any preceding period. When Prime Minister Modi came to power, India was the tenth largest economy in GDP terms in the world. Presently, the fifth, sixth &amp; seventh economies namely United Kingdom, France &amp; India are within a very narrow range. India is projected to grow next year at 7.5%. In 2013-14, the UPA Government left behind an annual inflation figure of 9.4%. In the 5 years of PM Shri @narendramodi ji, the inflation figure has been 5.9%, 4.9%, 4.5%, 3.6% and 3.9%.The Modi Government fixed a Statutory inflation target in the range of 4% +/- 2%. If we analyse India's GDP growth &amp; inflation during post-liberalisation period i.e. since 1991, during the period 2014-19 GDP growth of 7.3% &amp; inflation 4.6 stand most remarkable, which has improved the quality of life of a large number of Indians. Political stability, decisive leadership and a clear mandate have a direct and positive relationship with growth. This is visible in India during 2014-19 NDA government under leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji.

For India\u2019s middle class, in the last five years, not a single tax has been increased. Indirect taxes have been merged into one in the GST. The GST is the single most important \u2018consumer friendly measure\u2019 in India. Taxes of most commodities have been brought down. There is a method for economically empowering the poor. Their purchasing power has improved. This helps trade &amp; businesses and impacts the economy positively. This is the first 5-year tenure of a Govt. where India has consistently remained the fastest growing economy. The NDA Govt. led by PM @narendramodi ji has taken a number of pro-poor economic measures including reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections &amp; substantial relief to middle class. This is how the poor and the middle class benefited the most from the govt.'s Policies. How the Poor and the Middle Class Benefitted Most from the Modi Government Policies?    https://t.co/IQJbxU4NmN Chaired 32nd meeting of the GST Council, Delhi, January 10, 2019 https://t.co/oVIZnbRhhw The GST council in its 32nd meeting today accorded massive relief for MSME sector. Free accounting and billing software will be made available to small assessees upto Rs.1.5 crore turnover. Exemption limit for paying GST for goods increased from Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.40 lakhs.  For North-East and hill States, the exemption limit has been raised from Rs.10 lakhs to Rs.20 lakhs To ease compliance burden, a single annual return with quarterly tax payments has been introduced for the composition schemes. A new composition scheme has been introduced for services sector and for mixed transactions of goods and services with turnover limit of Rs.50 lakhs at 6% GST. The limit of composition schemes for goods has been raised to Rs.1.5 crore at 1% GST rate. The Constitution 124th Amendment Bill provides reservation to economically weaker sections of the society in higher educational institutions &amp; in jobs. This endeavour of the govt. led by PM @narendramodi ji now ensures social justice &amp; empowerment for all, #SabkaSaathSabkaVikas With passage of the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019 by Rajya Sabha, a historical reform for equality and equal opportunity has come into existence. Govt. accomplishes its commitment to #SabkaSaathSabkaVikas #NewIndia Are there any real issues before Left affiliated Trade Unions for  organising a Bharat Bandh on the 8th &amp; 9th January, 2019 or is it a part of their strategy to organise a symbolic unrest to ensure that they are not wiped out from the political map of India. It is, therefore, important to analyse the number of steps taken by the NDA Government headed by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji to help the workers of India. These measures I have highlighted in my write up. The NDA Govt. has been in power for a little less than five years.  A GoM had been constituted to continuously maintain a dialogue with the trade unions. Some unions have been more forthcoming in the dialogue &amp; they succeeded in persuading the Govt. for measures in their favour. The Present Government and the Workers   https://t.co/SX7fz2DAtq My statement in Lok Sabha with respect to the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019, January 8, 2019 https://t.co/IXGwsBOzos I condemn the attack on the house of Sh. Muraleedharan, MP (RS). These tactics will not scare the BJP. Two individuals deserve a special credit. Sh. @NandanNilekani  who started it &amp; Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, who subsequently provided it with the direction and expansion. He masterminded the Govt. strategy to repel the legal challenges. Aadhaar is a game changer. The UPA, because of its contradictions &amp; indecision remained halfhearted about Aadhaar. Instead of taking credit, Congress lawyers challenged it in Court appearing as anti-technology, anti-Aadhaar faces. A decisive PM @narendramodi ji made it possible. The total amount of subsidy transferred through Aadhaar now equals Rs.169,868 crores. With the elimination of middlemen the benefits go directly to the bank accounts. Implemented only in India. The monies saved through Aadhaar is money fruitfully employed for the poor elsewhere. In most schemes the direct benefit transfer takes place to the beneficiaries\u2019 63.52 crore bank accounts that had been linked with the unique identity 'Aadhaar' as on December 15, 2018. The total number of subsidy transactions through Aadhaar are almost about 425 crore. The Govt. estimates that Rs.90,000 crore have been saved by the use of Aadhaar till March, 2018. Several duplicate, fake, &amp; non-existent beneficiaries have been eliminated. According to the @WorldBank Digital Dividend Report India can save Rs.77,000 crore /year by using Aadhaar . 22.80 crore of PAHAL &amp; Ujjwala beneficiaries are given cooking gas subsidies through  DBT in their Aadhaar linked bank accounts . 58.24 crore ration card holders stand linked. 10.33 crore MGNREGA card holders get  wage payment through DBT in their bank accounts. The NDA Govt. re-examined the UPA law &amp; completely changed it. The pith &amp; substance of the new law was to effectively use public resources in subsidising poor. In the last 28 months over 122 crore Aadhaar numbers are issued &amp; 99% of the adult population of India stands covered. The UPA itself was a divided house on Aadhaar. Its non statutory status triggered a serious legal challenge. While Sh. @NandanNilekani pushed hard, a senior Minister blocked it. The Prime Minister was indecisive  &amp; the enrollment continued, though at a very moderate pace. Benefits of the Aadhaar \u2013 where it stands today   https://t.co/CB0iiwDruO Well done! Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman ji, for an outstanding performance. You demolished the fake campaign. We are all proud of your performance. @nsitharaman Warm birthday greetings to my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers, Shri Vijay Goelji. May he be blessed with good health and a long life. @VijayGoelBJP My response in Rajya Sabha on J&amp;K Statutory Resolution, January 3, 2019  https://t.co/rR6QnEJKOD Increase in conversion of NPAs into standard accounts and decline in new accounts falling in NPA category show a definite improvement in the lending and borrowing behaviour. As per NCLT database, 4452 cases disposed at pre-admission stage, the amount apparently settled was around Rs 2.02 lakh crores. Some of the big 12 cases are likely to be resolved in this financial year in which realization is expected to be  around Rs 70,000 crores. So far 1322 cases have been admitted by NCLT. 4452 cases have been disposed at pre-admission stage and 66 have been resolved after adjudication. 260 cases have been ordered for liquidation. In 66 resolution cases, realization by creditors was around Rs. 80,000 crores The functioning of NCLT &amp; the appellate Tribunal has led to a large number of cases being filed. The NCLT is over-crowded, its capacity is now being further enhanced.  Further, the SC has pronounced several judgements expeditiously, laying down the Law on the IBC. Secondly, once a petition of the creditor is filed before the NCLT many debtors have been paying at the pre-admission stage so that the declaration of insolvency does not take place. Thirdly, many major cases have already been resolved &amp; many are on the way of resolution. The recoveries of monies parked in insolvent companies has taken place through three methods : firstly, after the introduction of Section 29(A) such companies are paying up in anticipation of not crossing red line and being referred to NCLT. The early harvest through the IBC process has been extremely satisfactory. It has changed the debtor - creditor relationship. The creditor no longer chases the debtor.  In fact, it is otherwise. The IBC was the quickest Economic legislative change that I have seen being made by Parliament. The NCLT &amp; the IBBI were immediately established, the regulations were framed &amp; by the end of 2016 corporate insolvency cases were being received by the NCLT. An effective governance. During 2008-2014,Banks lent indiscriminately. This lead to a very high percentage of NPAs which was highlighted by the Asset Quality Reviews of the RBI. This led to a prompt action by the Government, appointing an Expert Committee, which in its Report in 2015 recommended the IBC. The NDA Government headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee enacted the SARFAESI Law which proved to be much better than the earlier mechanisms. In the year 2000, the NPAs hit double digits. Both the SARFESI Law &amp; the prudent interest rate management by the RBI brought the NPAs down. The DRT was created to enable banks to recover every dues diligently. But these have not proved to be highly efficient mechanism for recovering debt. For non-corporate insolvencies, the Provincial Insolvency Act, a rusted piece of legislation, faded away because of disuse. The Congress left behind an anachronic system\u2019s legacy for resolving commercial insolvency. The Companies Act had a provision of winding up a company if it is unable to pay its debt. The SICA enacted in the 1980s\u2019 for rehabilitation of sick companies proved to be an utter failure Two years of insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC    https://t.co/4J6SaqowXW Why are the pseudo liberals silent?

Even a fool will not compare prices of a simple flyaway Aircraft with a weaponised Jet. Infrastructure creation, rural roads, building houses for the poor, providing them with electricity, toilets, gas connection. A higher tax base, greater revenue collection &amp; now healthcare has only been possible after initiatives taken by the govt. led by PM Sh. @narendramodi ji. This scheme is a game changer in healthcare.  Many people from the weaker sections avoided hospital treatment in order to avoid the burden of an unbearable payment.  Today 40% of India\u2019s poorest are assured of a treatment in a hospital at the cost of public expenditure. In the first 100 days, 6.85 lakh patients have been provided hospital treatment. 5.1 lakh claims have availed of the scheme, for which payment has been released. This averages 5000 claims per day for the first 100 days. No patient has had to pay a single Rupee. This Yojana covers 10.74 crore poor families, i.e., over 50 crore people. These weaker sections can avail of a medical scheme which covers hospitalisation charges spread over 1350 hospitalisation packages for a sum of Rs.5 lakh per year for the whole family. Born out of the necessity to provide people of India a system of resort in need is the Government\u2019s scheme of Aayushman Bharat/Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY). Govt. employees, armed forces, &amp; some pvt. sector corporates have healthcare provisions as part of their service conditions. Still, 62.58% of the Indian population has to pay their healthcare bills themselves. Most find it unaffordable &amp; such expenses pose a major challenge. India\u2019s healthcare system was always lacking. There were many other challenges including infrastructure inadequacy. We have many public &amp; private hospitals are of global quality &amp; price competitive. But for a large part of India\u2019s population, these are considered beyond reach. The Aayushman Bharat Scheme, which was launched on 23rd September, 2018 has completed 100 days.  These 100 days have witnessed the most significant steps in improving healthcare for the poor ever since independence. 100 days of Aayushman Bharat    https://t.co/tXHbyVX1Ks Wish you all a very #HappyNewYear2019 https://t.co/bCeTkLJBW3 Those who have recently shown a belated concern for institutional independence should seriously introspect as to what they did to the CBI when they were in power. Every word of what I have said in the letter, over the next five years, have proven to be true.   This is an irrefutable evidence of what the congress did to our investigative agencies. On 27/09/13, as the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, I had written to then PM Dr. Manmohan Singh a letter detailing the politicization of the investigation in the Sohrabudin, Tulsi Prajapati, Ishrat Jahan, Rajinder Rathore and the Haren Pandya cases. The Congress President Sh. Rahul Gandhi raised the issue \u201cthat nobody killed Sohrabudin\u201d. It would have been more appropriate if he had asked the right question \"who killed Sohrabudin case investigation?\", he would have got the right answer. Who Killed the Sohrabudin Investigation    https://t.co/wROSS49SZf Saddened by the demise of noted filmmaker of global repute Shri Mrinal Sen, former member of Rajya Sabha.

Irresponsible politics and irresponsible economics is only a race to the bottom. The political noise outside is inconsistent with the harmony inside the GST Council.   It is a body that has behaved with utmost responsibility since its establishment. The Congress legacy of indirect tax was a 31% tax.  We transiently put them in the 28% slab.  As the revenues kept increasing, we started bringing down the rates.  Most of the commodities have seen tax reduced. Multiple slabs were fixed transiently in order to ensure the tax on no commodity goes up radically. This contained the inflation impact. Most Aam Aadmi items were placed in the 0 or 5% tax bracket. Returns became online; assessments will be online; multiple inspectors disappeared States were charging an entertainment tax from 35% to 110%. This came down radically.  235 items were being charged at either 31% tax or even higher. All except 10 such items were brought down immediately to 28%. The 10 such items were brought down to even a lower rate i.e.18%. The GST from the date of its implementation, has changed the situation radically. All seventeen taxes were combined into one. The whole of India became one market. The interstate barriers disappeared. Entry into the cities became open with abolition of the entry tax. India probably had the worst indirect tax system anywhere in the world. Both the Centre and the State Governments were entitled to levy a set of taxes. There were 17 taxes levied.  An entrepreneur, therefore, faced seventeen inspectors, seventeen returns and seventeen assessments Eighteen Months of the GST       https://t.co/eIU3DCd90l Addressed media on the 31st meeting of the GST Council, December 22, 2018 https://t.co/cQMjqD1Flw The power existed and was used during the UPA Government also.  How else will terrorists who use technology extensively be traced?  Otherwise, the terrorists will use IT, but the intelligence and investigative agencies will be crippled. Congress Party talks first and thinks later. There is no general snooping order. The power to intercept in the interest of national security and public order already exists in law. This is only an order as to who are the authorised agencies. In fact, during UPA-II in a detailed debate in Parliament relating to a corporate lobbyist, the then Home Minister Shri P. Chidambaram strongly defended this power of interception being given to taxation authorities. The rules required authorised agencies to be notified.  In the absence of this authorisation, any police officer may start exercising the power. There are safeguards, as prescribed by the Supreme Court, which are included in the rules.  An interception or monitoring is only authorised under an specific approval of the Home Secretary. The Information Technology Act has been in existence for almost two decades. Section 69 of the IT Act authorises in the interest of sovereignty, integrity etc. to direct a notified agency to intercept or monitor or decrypt an information stored in a computer resource. Congress Party is running since morning an ill-informed campaign that Govt. has allowed snooping on computers and is violating the Right of Privacy. The Congress Party has got into the habit of speaking out first and understanding the issue only subsequently. Our military is a professional one and subject to a civilian authority. We owe it to our armed forces the gratitude of having successfully defended this nation.  After having ruled this country for decades, the grand old Party needs to mature. The Congress Spokespersons have broken a long-standing unwritten rule of Indian politics by criticising the Chief of the Indian Air Force for having stated that the Air Force urgently needs the Rafale to improve its combat ability. The Congress Speaks Without Thinking     https://t.co/hpXvEuOZ4T The UPA had left behind a legacy of 31% indirect Tax on most items. The GST has already reduced 334 items to 12% and 18% slab. Wasn\u2019t the 31% Tax an oppressive idea- a stupid one at that. A single slab GST argued by the Congress President is indeed a stupid Idea. Luxury and sin items can\u2019t be taxed at the same rate as the common man\u2019s item. If any NDA/BJP Government had stopped an opposition Programme, it would have been called an \u201cUndeclared Emergency\u201d. Why Silence now?

Sajjan Kumar\u2019s conviction by the Delhi High Court is a delayed vindication of Justice. The Congress and the Gandhi family legacy will continue to pay for the sins of 1984 riots. The judgement of the SC notes with satisfaction that procedural compliances have been done in the Rafale deal &amp; charges are misconceived.  After the judgement, this debate should have come to an end. But neither lobbyists nor political opponents will ever give up their brief. The judgement of the Supreme Court notes with satisfaction that procedural compliances have been done in the Rafale deal and the charges on the same are misconceived. Thirdly, with international cooperation and Governmental cooperation, scamsters of the UPA Government are now being extradited into India.  There is obviously a scare of who will talk how much &amp; Rahul Gandhi got instant support from the \u201ccareer nationalists\u201d of Lutyens Delhi. Secondly, Rahul Gandhi has the burden of a stigmatised legacy which was tainted by Bofors.  He was desperate trying to bring an \u2018immoral equivalence\u2019 between Rafale and Bofors.  But Rafale did not have middlemen, no kickbacks and obviously no Ottavio Quattrocchi. Rahul\u2019s opposition was obviously for reasons including his intolerance to the fact that PM @narendramodi ji has run the cleanest ever Government in recent Indian history.  It is a scam-free Government where middlemen and scamsters had to take refuge outside the country. As a political opponent Rahul Gandhi\u2019s opposition to the deal was a desperate attempt. It was the UPA Government which had shortlisted the Rafale.  PM @narendramodi ji in an IGA struck a deal with the French Govt. to further improve the terms &amp; conditions including the prices. All the lies spoken on the Rafale deal has been exposed. The Supreme Court judgement is clear.  Every word said against the Government has proved to be false.  Every \u201cfact\u201d stated by the vested interests against the deal has proved to be manufactured.

Removing agrarian distress and improving the quality of life in rural areas cannot be done by slogans alone. The NDA has pumped in resources into the rural areas. These resources are improving the rural life. There has been increased investment in agricultural research and education.  Investment in irrigation has substantially increased.  To help the poorest, under the Rural Job Employment Scheme this year close to Rs. 60,000 crore, if not more, would be spent on MGNREGA. In 2017, the Ujjwala Yojana to provide cooking gas connection to poor households was launched.  In just over one and a half years, 5.8 crore households have already been provided with cooking gas connections.  This figure is likely to touch 8 crore by 31/03/2019. There are 17.47 crore rural households in India. As of 2013-14 only about 70% were electrified.  Today as of November, 2018, 16.53 crore households (95%) have already been electrified and over the next few weeks rural electrification programme would be completed. In the past four and a half years, the NDA govt. led by PM @narendramodi ji has been instrumental in building close to 1.9 lakh kms. of rural roads. Prior to 26th May 2014 in first 67 years only 3.8 lakh kms. of regular roads existed, till Nov.'18, this has reached 5.7 lakh kms. The NDA Government planned a multi-pronged strategy to improve the quality of life in Indian villages, to enlarge quantum of investment and to make the Indian farmer self-sufficient and farming remunerative rather than be only dependent on State agencies. The UPA government led by Congress party pumped inadequate resources into the agricultural sector that had led to both an agrarian distress &amp; an inadequate quality of life in the rural areas. Since 26th May, 2014 the NDA govt. has been trying its best to mitigate this distress.

The sooner the Congress Party realises that its policy paralysis pushed India into the Fragile 5, the better it will be for the Party and its leadership. The Congress Party\u2019s reaction is given by those who perhaps have a nodding acquaintance with the subject. Data based on facts and on the best global practices is rejected by the Party because it takes away the last of its surviving arguments \u201cmy GDP growth was higher than yours\u201d. Those who hailed the new series in 2015, now consider the backward extension of this series as a \u201chatched job\u201d and a \u201cbad joke\u201d. This is but strange that what delights some when data shows an upward trend depresses them if it moves in the reverse direction. The CSO, in the year 2015, changed the way of calculating GDP. Once the new GDP estimates were given, my predecessor Shri P. Chidambaram publically welcomed the new series.  He said \u201cthe new data successfully establishes the fact that UPA succeeded to revive the economy.

This was proved in 2014 when dynastic parties lost miserably. India of2019 is different from India of 1971. The model of dynastic parties has one significant weakness.  Strength of the party is co-existent with the strength of the current generation of the dynasty.  If he is found to be non-inspirational in leadership, the party has to throw all its eggs in an incomplete basket. The country pays a price for dynastic policies as we have witnessed in several regions.  Three families \u2013 two of them in Srinagar and one in New Delhi in the last 71 years, have played with the destiny of Jammu and Kashmir.  The consequences are obvious. When the Sikhs were massacred in 1984, communal polarisation against them was considered a legitimate electoral strategy by the Congress. Today anti-BJPism leads the Congress to a situation where it can tie up with political rivals, sympathise with the Maoists, and separatists. When Panditji promoted his daughter as his successor, he laid the foundation of a dynastic democracy.  When the daughter, in 1975, turned dictatorial, it became the party\u2019s ideology to convert India into a \u201cdisciplined democracy\u201d. The dangers of officially glamorising one family at the cost of those who made a far greater contribution is dangerous both for the nation as also for the party to which they belong.  The contribution of other great stalwarts like Patel and Subhash Chandra Bose is downplayed. Sardar Patel\u2019s contribution was second to none.  Besides being a frontline leader of the freedom movement, he, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, negotiated the transfer of power with the British. He negotiated the integration of India with over 550 rulers. So, according to Congress millions of talented political workers coming from modest family backgrounds would fail by the Congress test of leadership. Merit, talent, ability to inspire &amp; lead would not be a virtue. The Congress considers only a great surname as a political brand. Gandhiji led the most extraordinary freedom movement of India.  He created, through political awareness, Satyagraha and non-violence, an environment where British found it impossible to continue in India. The argument given was that if you represent the legacy of a well-known family, it is a political point in your favour. This is the tragedy of Congress politics and its impact on the nation. The debate whether India should be a dynastic democracy has been ignited by a self-goal of the Congress Party.  The Prime Minister\u2019s mother\u2019s age was made a subject matter of the electoral debate.  His father\u2019s anonymity was commented upon as an inadequate credential of the PM.

May God bless him with a long healthy life &amp; success in all his endeavours. @BjpBiplab Greetings to everyone on the auspicious occasion of #GuruNanakJayanti https://t.co/3flcN3PUXL Briefing media on the decisions of the Union Cabinet, November 22, 2018 https://t.co/F7mcJCwpM0 Govt of India will develop a Kartarpur Corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur, Punjab to the international border to facilitate pilgrims from India to visit the holy Gurudwara Darbaar Sahib Kartarpur on the banks of Rabi river in Pakistan where Guru Nanak Devji spend 18 years The Indian society and particularly the Sikh community wants a closure of the horrible memories of 1984.  We owe to the victims that the other cases suggested by the SIT for investigation and prosecution be vigorously pursued &amp; the same is being done. Yesterday justice has been done in one case where two accused have been punished, one with life sentence and the other with death sentence.  There are thousands of such cases which required a similar punishment in 1980s itself. The period from 1984 to 1998 was one of cover-up. The First NDA Government led by Shri Atal Bihar Vajpayee appointed the Justice G.T. Nanavati Commission of Enquiry.  The Commission prepared an excellent Report giving details, Police-station wise, where the accused were prima facie guilty of crimes and the status of each case. In the aftermath the Congress Government tried to misrepresent facts.  Civil Liberty Organisations brought a detailed report on the extent of mob violence and injustice. The Report was banned. The Courts refused to lift the ban. Congressmen led violent mobs. The Police colluded with them. It did not fire, lathi charge or even teargas the mobs. The rioters were given a free hand to kill &amp; loot.  Places of worship of the Sikh community were damaged.  Sikh houses were burnt &amp; trade establishments looted. The Congressmen led groups of mourners &amp; protesters shouting \u201cKhoon Ka Badla Khoon\u201d. This provocative slogan was shown in television on Doordarshan continuously in round-the-clock telecast. Anti-Sikh violence started in several parts of the country. Delhi was the worst affected. The direct fallout of the disastrous operation in June, 1984 at the Golden Temple was the assassination of the Prime Minister. This was one of the most unfortunate and condemnable acts in Indian history. It also indicated a failure of governance.  It proved to be catastrophic. Anticipating elections towards the end of 1984, the Congress Party Government allowed the militancy in Punjab to go unchecked. Operation Bluestar succeeded in hurting the psyche of India\u2019s most patriotic community. A myopic Govt. did not consider the political cost of this move. A Delhi Court has awarded two accused in the 1984 Sikh Massacre case to Death penalty and life imprisonment.  This gives us an opportunity to look back at the legacy of 1984. THE LEGACY OF 1984 https://t.co/kYsPycqW5R Grenade attack &amp; killing of innocent people at Nirankari Satsang Bhawan in Rajasansi, Amritsar is highly condemnable. My thoughts are with the bereaved families, prayers for speedy recovery of those injured. Perpetrators of this heinous act will not be spared.

Is Rahul Gandhi\u2019s failed politics compelling him to render India\u2019s sensitive defence requirements controversial? Realising that the Modi government bought the Rafale at a price cheaper than what UPA was negotiating the disrupter\u2019s are now reporting to petty hair-splitting.

Congrats! to people of Varanasi on inauguration of Multi-Modal Waterways Terminal by PM @narendramodi ji.

More formalisation, more revenue, more resources for the poor, better Infrastructure, and a better quality of life for our citizens. Government has used these resources for better infrastructure creation, social sector and Rural India. How else could we visualise villages being connected by Road, electricity in every home, 92% coverage for rural sanitation, a successful Awas Yojana, a cooking gas connection. Despite an annual income tax relief of Rs. 97,000 Crore given to the smaller tax payers and a Rs. 80,000 Crore relief given to the GST assesses, tax collections have gone up.  Rates of taxes, both direct and indirect have been reduced, but tax collections have gone up. In May, 2014, when the present Government was elected the total number of the filers of income tax returns was 3.8 crore.  In the first four years of this Government, it has increased to 6.86 crore. Demonetisation &amp; implementation of the GST curbed cash transactions in a big way. With a visible increase in the digital transactions, formalisation of the economy has led to increase in the tax payer base from 6.4 million in the pre-GST regime to 12 million. The impact of demonetisation has been felt on collection of personal income tax. Its collections were higher in Financial Year 2018-19 (till 31-10-2018) compared to the previous year by 20.2%.  Even in the corporate tax the collections are 19.5% higher. The Government first targeted the black money outside India.  Asset holders were asked to bring it back on payment of penal tax, on failure to do so they are being prosecuted under the Black Money Act.  All such details received have resulted in action against the violators. As we complete 2 years of demonetisation today, it has been established that demonetisation, a key step in a chain of important decisions taken by the Government, had a huge impact in formalising the economy.

May he be blessed with good health, long life and a successful year ahead. @DrJitendraSingh Addressed National Conference on Public Procurement and Competition Law, New Delhi, November 5, 2018 https://t.co/gFVXJdg8PO We have yet again demonstrated a firm commitment to peace and safeguarded our strategic and security interests. India achieves the nuclear triad with the first successful INS Arihant\u2019s deterrence patrol. Today is the day of great pride for 130 crore Indians and our armed forces. Addressing at the launch of Support and Outreach Initiative for MSMEs, New Delhi, November 2, 2018 https://t.co/TStXi0hrFf Killing of BJP state secretary Anil Parihar and his brother in J&amp;K\u2019s Kishtwar is an act of cowardice. It is an extremely deplorable act. This is an attempt to derail the peace process in the region. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the family of Shri Parihar. If we are able to keep the present pace of reforms in the identified areas, the targets set by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji would start looking a modest one.  Only a focussed and a purpose oriented Government could have achieved this. On the \u2018Starting of Business\u2019, India improved in four years by 21 points.  In \u2018Construction Activity\u2019, 4year improvement is a massive 132 points. For \u2018Getting Electricity\u2019, we have improved a phenomenal 132 positions. I am sure with our hard work very soon we will be in top 50. We inherited the legacy of India at 142, but in the first 2 years we moved up &amp; retained 130 place. In the third year, we have made a major jump of 30 places to break into100 and in the 4th year, we have moved to 77.  This is a 65 position improvement in the first four years. During ten years of the UPA, governance in India &amp; corruption appeared synonymous with icing of policy paralysis &amp; abandonment of reforms.  UPA-II, for its 5 year tenure, witnessed global ranking of 134, 132, 132, 134 and finally 142. This was UPA\u2019s miserable track record. India and the Ease of Doing Business  https://t.co/dJkihKNCvI GST collections for October 2018 have crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore. The success of GST is lower rates, lesser evasion, higher compliance, only one tax and negligible interference by taxation authorities. In four years India has moved from 142 to 77th place in the #EaseofDoingBusiness India has made significant strides on various #EoDB indicators including Tax reforms, insolvency to name a few. I congratulate all the stakeholders on making India proud time and again. Reforms undertaken by NDA govt. led by PM Shri @narendramodi ji are continuously giving results. India advanced 23 spots to 77th place in the World Bank 'Ease of Doing Business' ranking. India is continuing its reform agenda &amp; is in the league of global top improvers.

Khuranaji had for five decades an electrifying connect with the people of Delhi. He was their voice. Khuranaji\u2019s best moment was during the emergency when for the first four months he evaded arrest, remained underground and set up an invisible organisation to fight the emergency. Khuranaji was a dedicated and loyal BJP leader. His dynamism was unparalleled. Condolences on the demise of veteran BJP leader and former Delhi CM Shri #MadanLalKhurana ji.

Shri Tiwari was a political stalwart. May God render peace to the departed soul. \u0950 \u0936\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f l Today I feel it is much more than hallucinations. Is it a personality issue where he lies a dozen times and then in self delusion believes it to be true or is it a case of a \u2018Clown Prince\u2019 out-clowning himself? How does he concoct this falsehood?  At the Hindustan Times Summit, he referred to a meeting he had with me and attributed same statements to me.  When asked I merely said that \u2018I can\u2019t answer hallucinations.  I am in the distinguished company of President Macron\u2019. THE TRUTH: The country has become one market, all check-points have been abolished, inspectors have disappeared and the returns are now filed online and most assessments will be online.  All States, including Congress ruled States have approved the model and the rates. Falsehood 3 - On GST he mentions that it is flawed and needs to be changed. THE TRUTH: Loans were given during the UPA period.  Not a single Rupee has been waived.  The Promotors of the defaulting companies have been thrown out through the IBC, banks are recovering their loans/dues through the process of NCLT. Falsehood 2- He repeats congenitally despite being corrected several times that once an account is declared as NPA it amounts to a loan waiver. He then builds a false narrative of the PM having waived the loan of his 15 friends. THE TRUTH: Rafale aircraft and its weaponry is not being manufactured in India at all, neither by Dassault or by any other private company. All 36 aircrafts and their weapons in a fully fly away and usable form will arrive in India. There are over 120 offset suppliers &amp; not one. Falsehood 1- He repeatedly says that a private business house in India has got an advantage ranging from Rs. 38,000 Crore to Rs. 1,30,000 Crore.  He further argues that what was to be manufactured by HAL is now being manufactured by a private business house with no experience. Those who advise Rahul Gandhi appear to have persuaded him that he is cut out only for beating the desk. Since it would not suffice, he must concoct an alternative, repeat the false narratives &amp; convince himself that falsehood in fact is a truth. Thereafter live in self-delusion.

Strategic and tactical capabilities of Indian Air Force keep our sky safe &amp; secure. Salute to the exemplary valour of our air force personnel. Must not the non-BJP States be candid with the people &amp; tell them that both in 2017 &amp; 2018 they refused to give any relief to the people even from their higher revenues. They sent out tweets and gave television bytes but when it came to performance, they looked the other way. The Centre charges a fixed amount as tax on oil.  What the Centre gets as tax revenue, 42% of it is passed on to the States. The States independently charge their VAT. The average VAT rate in the country is about 29%. The States benefit from higher oil prices. When the oil price was reduced yesterday, the critics did a volte-face and argued that this is bad economics.  Let me categorically assure all that there is no going back on deregulation of oil prices. In view of the increase, particularly in the direct tax revenue, the Centre decided to give between central excise and the absorptions by the OMCs, a Rs.2.5 relief to the consumer.  We requested the States to give a similar relief. We have requested the States to cut taxes on oil. Most of the BJP-NDA States did so. However others refused to do so. I had always maintained that in any extraordinary situation, the capacity of an economy to give relief will depend on its fiscal strength. Our government is highly sensitive to national interest and needs of the people. In the last four Budgets, the Modi Government, to the section of small and middle tax-paying population, has consistently given some direct tax relief each year. The NDA Government has an exemplary record of fiscal prudence. We have maintained the gradual glide path since 2014 to bring down fiscal deficit. We will continue to do so.

The PSBs have already recovered an amount of Rs. 36,551 crore during the first quarter of financial year 2018-19 against the total recoveries of Rs. 74,562 crore in financial year 2017-18. The cash recovery targets for PSBs for financial year 2018-19 is Rs. 1,81,034 crore. When NDA government came to power in 2014 it inherited large scale NPAs in the banking sector. Due to aggressive lending from 2008 to 2014 total outstanding loans of PSBs increased from Rs. 18 lakh crore in March 2008 to about Rs. 52 lakh crore by March 2014. An article has been reported in news media regarding write-off of loans by Public Sector Banks. Technical write-offs are not loan waivers &amp; recovery of loans continues by the Banks. In fact the defaulting management of most Insolvent companies has been removed under the IBC. Lessons for Rahul Gandhi from his Partyman    https://t.co/wUqkGaQXNZ In correct perspective, it may be advisable for Rahul Gandhi to get some \u2018words of wisdom\u2019 from Prof. K.V. Thomas. The Congress Party must remember that \u2018the days of crony capitalism are over.\u2019  The NDA Government deals with such challenges objectively and professionally. A senior congress leader &amp; Fmr. Union Minister Prof. K.V. Thomas, has written to me on 20th September, 2018 making such a request.  I am enclosing his letter.  It demolishes every word that Rahul Gandhi and his coterie has been spreading. Was it a scam in 2005 when LIC acquired 15% stake in IL&amp;FS and in March, 2006 when it acquired another 11.10% stake in the IL&amp;FS?  In fact, LIC further bought 19.34 lakh shares in IL&amp;FS in 2010. The financial institutions\u2019 investment in any company \u2013 \u2018is it a scam\u2019 as Rahul Gandhi and his coterie are spreading?    Was it a scam in 1987 when the IL&amp;FS was promoted with the Central Bank of India having 50.5% shares and the UTI having 30.5% shares? The Congress is a national saboteur.  It wants to sabotage India\u2019s economy by allowing a situation in relation to a company to persist, expand and become unmanageable.  It lacks statesmanship and vision. The Congress Party, for the last few days, has been busy spreading disinformation about the Government\u2019s possible moves in relation to the private sector company IL&amp;FS.

His second statement in Montreal, Canada to AFP makes the veracity of his first statement even more questionable. In this terse perspective the Congress Party\u2019s hullabaloo is their struggle to remain relevant. The partners (Dassault and Reliance) selected themselves as former President Hollande now says.  This contradicts his first questionable statement which the French Government and Dassault have denied. For the Congress Party to allege that a former President had been bribed by an Indian business group and then use him as a primary witness, particularly when he is facing criticism for an alleged conflict of interest within his own country. This is a classic congress faux pas. The offset partner is selected entirely by the Dassault Aviation, the original equipment manufacturer, and neither the French Government and nor the Indian Government has any say in the matter. There is no \u2018partnership\u2019, as suggested by the former President, with regard to the 36 Rafale aircrafts to be supplied by Dassault Aviation to the Govt. of India.  It was a Govt. to Govt. agreement under which the complete weaponised aircrafts are to come to the Indian Air Force. Without commenting on the correctness or otherwise of a controversy in the French media, it may be mentioned that the former French President, Hollande, is countering statement made against him with regard to a conflict of interest in his dealing with the Reliance Defence. This puts to rest the controversy which is sought to be created on the basis of a statement made by the former French President Hollande. The French Govt. &amp; M/s Dassault Aviation have categorically denied the correctness of the former President\u2019s first statement.  The French Government has stated that the decision with regard to the offset contracts of Dassault Aviation are taken by the company and not the Govt. A Questionable Statement Which Circumstances &amp; Facts Demolish     https://t.co/CBS5ZofgnD The world\u2019s largest democracy must seriously introspect whether public discourse should be allowed to be polluted by the falsehood of a \u2018Clown Prince\u2019. Today the UPA leaders falsely stated that when they went out of Government, the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) were only Rs.2.5 lakh crore.  In 2015, an asset quality review was conducted by the Reserve Bank of India and it was found that the NPAs were actually Rs.8.96 lakh crore. If the \u2018Rafale concoctions\u2019 were the first big lie, the second one stated repeatedly is that Mr. Modi waived off rupees two lakh fifty thousand crores of fifteen industrialists.  Every word of that sentence repeatedly uttered by Rahul Gandhi is false. There has been no reply on Rafale questions raised by me. In mature democracies those who rely on falsehood are considered unfit for public life. Many have been banished from political activity for lying. But this rule obviously can\u2019t apply to a dynastic party like Congress. The campaign of falsehood on Rafale entirely led by the Congress President exposes his strategy i.e. concoct a lie and repeat as many times.  This, at least, provides him some concocted material for his statements / speeches for otherwise an issueless Congress.

I wish him good health and a long life. May he continue to render for many more years his exceptional services to the nation and guide the country to its glory. @narendramodi The Central Government has announced the decision to enhance the compensation paid to the Anganwadi workers &amp; the Asha workers. This will go a long way in addressing the grievance of these workers &amp; strengthen their work as they are the mainstay of the National Nutrition Mission. With rural roads, rural electrification, rural Awas Yojana, toilets &amp; a cooking gas connection with foodgrain provided at a modest cost, the quality of life of India\u2019s rural poor will get a quantum jump. Additonally Ayushman Bharat, will change the quality of life in rural India. Toilets in several parts of India have been named \u201cIzzat Ghar\u201d.  This is for the first time that the subject matter in the toilet construction campaign has taken central stage of the national agenda.  It has become a subject matter of popular discussion. The hygiene in the utilization of the toilet is also a preventive healthcare scheme.   Global experts believe that the SBM will have saved over three lakh lives in the country by the time we become \u2018open-defecation free\u2019 in 2019. As we have completed 4 years of the Swachhata scheme, 39% rural sanitation coverage has increased to a phenomenal 92%.This was not an easy goal to achieve. This involved a behavioural change of the people. This \u2018people\u2019s movement\u2019 has today transformed into a \u2018women\u2019s movement\u2019. Swachhata campaign announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji in his Independence Day speech of 2014, has been one scheme in the history of independent India which the people of India snatched away from the Government and converted into a \u2018people\u2019s movement.\u2019 Two Successful Initiatives of the Central Government  https://t.co/Hgmqex61YK \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0935\u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964 #\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940_\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938 \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u0923\u0947\u0936 \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902 \u0964 #GaneshaChaturthi greetings to everyone. #\u0917\u0923\u0947\u0936\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0940 https://t.co/VIZ8UgoGBV I did not even receive the papers that he was holding in his hand.

Inaugurated the New Office Complex of Competition Commission of India (CCI) in New Delhi, August 30, 2018. https://t.co/iggidjyP1n Sharing my speech at the inauguration of New Office Complex of CCI, August 30, 2018 https://t.co/XGHaEbi3VV .@RahulGandhi has not read my question-The fully weaponised Rafale air craft\u2019s 2016 price is 20% cheaper than the 2007 offer. This is what the 2015 statement of the PM and the French President refers to as \u2018on terms better than the 2007 offers\u2019. .Any issue diversion by @RahulGandhi on my Rafale questions, will not wipe out his falsehood on Rafale. .Little knowledge is dangerous. @RahulGandhi\u2019s fiction on \u2018demonetisation helping NPA holders\u2019, forgets that the Modi Government legislated and enforced the IBC where the NPA defaulters lost their companies. The GST was implemented from 1st July, 2017 i.e. Post demonetisation.  In the very first year, the number of registered assesses has increased by 72.5%.  The original 66.17 Lakh assesses has increased to 114.17 Lakhs. This is a glimpse of formalisation. The number of New Returns filed post demonetisation increased in the past two years by 85.51 Lakhs and 1.07 crore. The Income Tax collections have increased from the 2013-14 figure of 6.38 Lakh crore to the 2017-18 figure of 10.02 Lakh crore. Data reveals itself to anyone prudent The phenomenal increase in the number of IT returns filed (in March 2014, it was 3.8 Cr.  In 2017-18, this figure has grown to 6.86 Cr) is reflective of impact of demonetisation along with evidence of growing economy. Cash once deposited removes anonymity of its owner. Accordingly,post demonetisation about 1.8 million depositors have been identified for enquiry.Many of them are being fastened with Tax and Penalties.Mere deposit in a bank does not lead to a presumption that it is Tax paid Money Was the invalidation of the Non-deposited currency the only object of demonetisation? Certainly Not. The larger purpose of demonetisation was to move INDIA from a Tax Non-compliant society to a compliant society, formalisation of the Economy and a clear blow to the black money. Demonetisation and its impact on Tax collection and Formalisation of the Economy https://t.co/g9zVoha5Cs Warm birthday greetings to my colleague in the Union Cabinet Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad ji. May God bless him with a long healthy life. @rsprasad Let me remind you of a JPC the Congress Government appointed in 1987 on the Bofors deal.  It was headed by Mr. Shankaranand.  It gave a report that the kickbacks were \u2018winding up\u2019 charges.  The whole world rejected the findings of that JPC.  Why a JPC to satisfy your falsehood? Mr. Gandhi, truth holds together, falsehood falls apart \u2013 that is the fate of your Rafale falsehood. Mr. Gandhi, you have not attempted to answer my questions on the \u2018Rafale purchase in the interest of national security\u2019.  When no answers are given, obviously no answers could have been given by those who resort only to falsehood. Sharing my interview with ANI on the Rafale, August 29, 2018 https://t.co/ABznj7vqul I am asking these questions as his misadventure is impairing national interest and I hope Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party would respond immediately. In Jaipur he used the two figures \u2013 Rs.520Cr &amp; Rs.540Cr in the same speech. In Hyderabad, he invented a new price of Rs.526 Cr. Truth has only one version, falsehood has many.  Are these allegations being made without any familiarity with the facts of the Rafale purchase? Rahul Gandhi quoted a price of Rs.700 Cr per aircraft in Delhi and Karnataka in April and May this year. In Parliament, he reduced it to Rs.520 Cr per aircraft, in Raipur he increased it to Rs.540 Cr; Which establish truth as a victim of Shri Rahul Gandhi and his party merely peddling his falsehoods.  Needless to say that I am constrained by the secrecy clause, which exists in the contract and whatever I ask or respond to would be constrained by that limitation. I have decided to ask the following questions to the Congress Party and its President. Needless to say that if replies are received in the public space or even if there is an issue diversion and no reply is received, I would be constrained to come out with further specific facts Secondly, every fact that Shri Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party has spoken on pricing and procedure are completely false, &amp; thirdly, Congress Party\u2019s effort of raising these issues is to further delay a defence procurement so that India\u2019s defence preparedness further suffers. The Congress Party and its leader, Shri Rahul Gandhi, are guilty on three counts: firstly, the UPA delayed the deal by over a decade comprising national security; Issue on Rafale raised is based on complete falsehood. It is expected from national political parties &amp; its responsible leaders to keep themselves informed of the basic facts before they enter a public discourse on defence transactions. On 10th April, 2015, the Government of India and the French Government issued a joint statement where India decided to procure 36 Rafale aircrafts from the French Government on terms better than the ones conveyed by Dassault in the L1 bid of 2007. Congress Party\u2019s false campaign launched on Rafale aircraft deal based on peddled untruth has been casting a cloud on the Inter-Governmental agreement &amp; seriously compromising national security. 15 Questions that Expose Congress Party\u2019s Falsehood on Rafale    https://t.co/Jab0eMYGAh Addressing AGM of Indian Banks' Association, August 27, 2018 https://t.co/aWK1douafO Received Report of the Committee to Review Offences under the Companies Act, 2013, August 27, 2018 https://t.co/dtBfllVj1E Strongly condemn the attack on Sardar Manjit Singh GK in California.

An analysis of what the IMF had to say in 2014 as against 2018 is very clear - high inflation, high fiscal deficit, high current account deficit, a standstill infrastructure, power sector, &amp; allocation of natural resources.

Eid al-Adha greetings #EidMubarak https://t.co/ihVi3iJ6Jd Birthday greetings to Shri Pema Khandu ji, Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh. May he be blessed with good health, long life &amp; a successful year ahead. @PemaKhanduBJP. Post 2014, when the global economy was in slowdown mode, it was India and India alone which has been the fastest growing economy in the world for the last four years and has consistently overtaken China in the growth rate. The UPA govt. compromised on all macro fundamentals. It compromised on the fiscal deficit and the Current Account Deficit, it allowed inflation to spiral out of control and more so to create an illusory growth, it compromised India\u2019s banking system through reckless lending. It is clear that the growth during UPA-1 was during the period of global boom. It inherited an 8% plus growing economy from the NDA government. The global tailwinds supported India. Emerging markets were all growing at a higher rates. To ensure that growth is maintained, UPA govt. took two steps, firstly, fiscal discipline was compromised and secondly, the banking system was advised to go in for reckless lending, evergreening loans and camouflaging NPA. This led to banks having no capital to lend further. Given global scenario 10 years of UPA could have been great opportunity for India but it was lost. As there were no significant domestic reforms carried out during this period. However, when this honeymoon ended, growth started slipping down. For India to grow at a high rate during 2003-08 was quite obvious. The NDA Government led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee went out of office in 2004 leaving behind an 8% plus growth rate, additionally the Government had the benefit of a continuous incremental reforms from 1991-2004. Growth During the UPA \u2013 Its Quality and Circumstances https://t.co/xKcdJow31f Atalji has left the world.  But the era of which he laid the foundation will prosper even more.  That is the Vajpayee legacy. Once in AIIMS his doctor asked him \u201cKya Aap Jhuk Gaye The?\u201d, to which the man in pain not losing his sense of humour replied in the context of the Emergency: \u201c\u091d\u0941\u0915\u0928\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0938\u0940\u0916\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0938\u093e\u0939\u092c \u0964 \u092f\u0942\u0901 \u0915\u0939\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0921 \u0917\u090f \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947\u201d  later he penned \u201c\u091f\u0942\u091f \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0917\u0930 \u0939\u092e \u091d\u0941\u0915 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947\u201d The Nuclear Test in 1998 was a defining moment of his Government.  He went out of the way to work for peace with Pakistan.  But when the need arose, he inflicted a severe blow to it in Kargil.  Both Pokhran and Kargil were high points of his Primeministership. He had no personal enemies since he spoke mostly on issues rather than individuals.  He was a wordsmith. He will be remembered the most for oration both in Parliament and outside.  In Parliament, he was heard in pin drop silence. His oration was always blended with humour. The battle against the Emergency and for restoration of democracy was fought by Jan Sangh under his leadership.  After a brief experience in the Janata Government, the Jan Sangh was back to square one, but Atalji guided it where BJP is today. Atalji\u2019s demise is referred as end of an era.  I, however, consider it as a continuation of the era of which he was one who laid the foundation.  His political journey shaped his ideology.  His convictions were shaped by his deep commitment to the nation. Atalji, the Quintessential Gentleman \u2013 How he made a difference?  https://t.co/8pa9Pot0zR His vision, oration, poetry, blended with his national commitment earned him respect from both friends and opponents. Saddened by the demise of Atalji, unquestionably one of the tallest leaders of India.  His contribution to India and India\u2019s democracy will be always remembered. The developments are being monitored closely to address any situation that may arise in the context of the unsettled international environment. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are comfortable by global standards and sufficient to mitigate any undue volatility in the foreign exchange market. However India\u2019s Macro fundamentals remain resilient and strong. Recent developments relating to Turkey have generated global risk aversion towards emerging market currencies and the strengthening of the dollar.

He will be remembered for his contributions which enriched Indian politics. He was an outstanding Parliamentarian. My speech in Rajya Sabha after election of Deputy Chairman, August 9, 2018 https://t.co/xazK5WCSEt Congratulations to Shri Harivansh ji on being elected as Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha. Our best wishes to him for the new assignment. Those raising alarm about the alleged national security cause ought to realise their responsibility &amp; refrain from politicising for narrow individual ends those very matters pertaining to national security that were consistently ignored by them. The unsubstantiated allegations against the Government constitute nothing but reprocessed lies by forces increasingly desperate to prove their relevance. The Government had already responded effectively to each and every distortion and misinformation on the issue. There is not a grain of truth in the wild allegations repeated today nor anything substantiating in the purported facts and voluminous documents marshalled to corroborate the baseless accusations. Attempt at maligning the Government by spreading falsehood and paddling fabricated facts regarding the 2016 Inter-Governmental Agreement for the procurement of Rafale fighter aircraft is highly reprehensible &amp; will fail as it did in Parliament. The Rafale Falsehood Repeated https://t.co/1oVTnwUUkI Extremely pained by the sad demise of an exceptional politician &amp; mass leader Kalaignar Karunanidhi ji. He was a great human being. His contributions to Tamil Nadu &amp; national politics will always be remembered. My condolences to his family members &amp; the party. With passing of the 123rd Constitution Amendment Bill by the Parliament, the NDA govt. led by PM @narendramodi ji has accomplished a significant step today towards empowering our OBC communities. Constitutional status to the NCBC will expedite their overall growth &amp; development. Birthday greetings to Shri Vijay Rupani Ji, Chief Minister of Gujarat. May he be blessed with good health and a long life. @vijayrupanibjp Leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee must realise that India\u2019s sovereignty is not a play thing.  Sovereignty and citizenship are the soul of India. Imported vote banks are not. I reiterate what I have stated earlier. The Congress was the mainstream party on Indian politics.  It has increasingly started taking fringe position.  Siding with the \u2018Tukde Tukde\u2019 gang was one such illustration.  It is now compromising the sovereignty of India. The result of this has been that in the 50 years between 1961 and 2011, the majority community in Assam has grown 2.4 times; the minority has grown 3.9 times.  This has caused a major demographic impact. India\u2019s sovereignty is paying a heavy price because of the quality of its political discourse. Though Mrs. Indira Gandhi &amp; Mr. Rajiv Gandhi took a position in 1972 &amp;1985 for the deletion &amp; deportation of foreigners, Rahul Gandhi takes a contrarian position&amp; his party turns turtle The West Bengal CM, Mamata Banerjee has stated in the LS on 4.8..2005: \u201cThe infiltration in Bengal has become a disaster now... I have both the Bangladeshi &amp; the Indian voters list. This is a very serious matter.  I would like to know when would it be discussed in the House?\u201d Historically, both Mrs. Indira Gandhi and Mr. Rajeev Gandhi, through the Congress Government that they headed, committed to this nation that post 25th March, 1971 migrants would be detected, identified and deported. The SC in Sarbananda Sonowal vs UOI (2005) held \"...The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of geostrategically vital districts of lower Assam.  The influx of these illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region...\" Ever since Independence, we had a significant influx of illegal migrants from East Pakistan.  Because of ethnic and linguistic similarity and religious commonality, it was possible for these people together to avoid detection and find a shelter in Assam. Independent India has faced a major challenge to protect its sovereignty in Jammu and Kashmir.  At the time of Independence and partition of India, Assam was also a sore issue for Pakistan.  They resented the fact that like Kashmir, Assam became a part of Independent India. National Register of Citizens \u2013Sovereignty vs Vote Bank https://t.co/lagaxp8agI The investigators must also realise that it is only professionalism and fairness which will ensure a higher rate of conviction.  Punishing the corrupt has to be judiciously balanced with non-harassment of the honest. The only group unhappy with the present amendment of the PC Act is some NGO\u2019s who are not aware of the needs of governance, quick decision making and growth.  For these groups \u2018chaos\u2019 and \u2018decision making paralysis\u2019 is better than stability and growth. The fundamental flaw in the 1988 Act resulted into harassment of many honest persons leading to abysmal or no conviction. Reputations were ruined &amp; a fear amongst decision makers was created.  This witnessed a tendency where civil servants would postpone decision making. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013 passed by the Parliament in the ongoing monsoon session seeks to punish the bribe giver &amp; bribe taker.  It provides protection for assisting the investigative agency.  Even non-monetary gratification has been included within it. The GST Council within a record period of thirteen months has almost phased out the 28 percent category, items remaining in this category are only luxury items or sin goods. It is only a matter of time that the final obituary of the \u2018Congress Legacy Tax\u2019 is written. The pre-GST indirect tax was a Congress Party legacy. Items of household use from mineral water, hair oil, toothpaste, soap, dairy to construction material and white goods, all were taxed at 31 percent. The total number of goods falling in this category was 235. In 28 meetings till date the GST Council has reviewed the rates on a continuous basis. In comparison to pre GST 31 percent tax, which was Congress Party\u2019s gift imposed on India, GST provided respite to tax payers &amp; consumers by bringing down this tax substantially. The complicated, inefficient, &amp; multiple Indirect tax system of pre GST era where each assessee could be levied upto 17 different taxes was replaced by the NDA govt. with a simpler indirect tax system GST. Two Significant Reforms of the Week  https://t.co/PGtInvab5R \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u0905\u0935\u0938\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902 \u0964 Salute to indomitable courage of our soldiers  #KargilVijayDiwas https://t.co/uePvkxfVb8 Many in the Congress realise that 2019 is not their election. They should try &amp; improve but concentrate as a priority on 2024.  However, mid-level leaders of the Congress in the age group of 65 to 74 are unwilling to wait for 2024.  They know that 2019 is their last chance. The first part of the Congress Mukt Bharat was scripted by the BJP, the federal front is more than eager to script the part-2 of the same. Its message to the Congress is clear \u2013 \u2018you will have to support us; the other way is not possible.\u2019 The Congress Party realises that there a danger of the next election becoming a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s performance. The popularity gap between the Prime Minister and his competitors is very wide.  Obviously Congress fearing complete decimation. The Rafale\u2019s fake controversy is first part of two fold strategy of Congress Party. The second part is comparison of Hindus with \u2018Taliban\u2019 and phrases such as \u2018Hindu Pakistan\u2019 to reclaim minority votes. This strategy also is likely to backfire. Congress Party\u2019s strategists have invented &amp; manufactured a fake issue of the Rafale deal. The issue is failing to cut much ice.  It\u2019s a Government to Government agreement with no private group involved. PM @narendramodi led scam free Government is a challenge to Congress Party. The Congress Party and the Fake Issue of Rafale https://t.co/M4vMxDFCTI #Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a great son of India. His patriotic ideals guided Indians in their fight against the British for the freedom of motherland. On his birth anniversary we remember his life and works and pay him our respectful tribute. Tributes to the great revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad on his birth anniversary. His indomitable courage and patriotism has been a guiding force for generations. Former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh need not be pessimistic about doubling rural incomes. If he compared the investment that the NDA government is making in the agriculture, rural and social sectors he will get the answer. Warm birthday greeting to Shri Devendra Fadnavis ji, Chief Minister of Maharashtra. May he be blessed with good health, a long life and success in all his endeavours. @Dev_Fadnavis Birthday greetings to Shri Ananth Kumar ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet. May God bless him with a long healthy life. @AnanthKumar_BJP This is a major step towards rationalising the 28% tax slab which has been narrowed to only a few commodities in the past thirteen months. #GSTCouncil in the 28th meeting has continued its endeavour to simplify processes, further rationalise tax rates, &amp; enhance cooperative federalism. Today\u2019s decisions of the Council will go a long way in pushing productivity upward. Hallucinations can give momentary pleasure to a person.   Therefore, to hallucinate after an embarrassing performance that he has won future election or to hallucinate that he is the reincarnation of Mark Antony may give him self-satisfaction but\u2013 in fact it is a serious problem. Is he unaware of the fact that the UPA proposed GST amendment to the Constitution never included petroleum products as part of the GST?  It is only the NDA which brought it within the GST with tax to be levied once agreed by the GST Council.  He seems unaware of public issues. @RahulGandhi has repeatedly shown that he is ignorant of facts. But to insist on disclosure of financial, which indirectly involves the disclosures of the strategic equipment on the aircraft, is to hurt national interest. Cost gives away a clue to the weaponry in the aircraft. Rahul Gandhi, by concocting a conversation with President Macron, has lowered his own credibility&amp;seriously hurt the image of an Indian politician before the world at large. Not to be aware of the fact that UPA Government Minister had signed the secrecy pact is not understandable A \u2018Vote of No Confidence\u2019 against the Government is a serious business.  It is not an occasion for frivolity.  Those who desire to be PM never blend ignorance, falsehood &amp; acrobatics. Regrettably, the President of the Congress Party missed a great opportunity. Frivolity and the No Confidence Motion https://t.co/dHBWuS87YQ Condolences on the sad demise of poet and lyricist Shri Gopaldas Neeraj ji. He will always be remembered for his evergreen Hindi songs. May God render peace to the departed soul. Salute to courage &amp; bravery of revolutionary #MangalPandey on his birth anniversary. https://t.co/pbK0ChgWEm Remembering Shri #GirdhariLalDogra ji on his birth anniversary. https://t.co/mMU0WuPL4j Prime Minister @narendramodi has clearly demonstrated the advantages of a decisive leadership. India\u2019s Prime Minister and his Government has to overcome the challenges that India faces today. The leader of the world\u2019s fastest growing economy cannot be a \u2018Bechara\u2019. To confront these challenges, India needs a strong and cohesive Government.  More so, it means a decisive political leadership.  It needs a Government which is able to resist unfair pressures of either allies or regions. India is today passing through a phase where a great opportunity awaits it. We need, for the next one decade &amp; more, a high trajectory growth. We are faced with the global challenge of terrorism &amp; the current economic challenges thrown up by rising crude oil prices &amp; trade war. Listening to these statements of Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, my memory took me back to the tragedy era of Hindi cinema. If this is the consequence of a two party coalition, what is it that a disparate group of parties with no ideological similarity offer to India? The political agenda for the debate this year appropriately will be Prime Minister \u201cModi versus an anarchist combination\u201d. The 2014 election conclusively established that in the \"New India\" chemistry will score over arithmetic, when it comes to deciding the country\u2019s destiny. An aspirational India which today occupies the high table in the world shall never accept an idea which has repeatedly failed. History teaches us this lesson. Aspirational societies with vibrant democracies do not invite anarchy. A strong nation abhors anarchy. To rule a large country like India through coalitions is possible but the nucleus of a coalition has to be stable. A federal front is a failed idea. It was experimented under Shri Charan Singh, Shri Chandrasekhar &amp; by the United Front Govt. during 1996-98 but failed to deliver. The Karnataka situation is an obvious consequence of a non-ideological opportunistic alliance with no positive agenda. The basis of the negative agenda is \u2018Keep Modi Out\u2019. These ideologically flexible political groups have an extremely dubious track record of governance. The country has been watching with keen interest the developments in Karnataka in the past two months.  It is a repeat of what the Congress did to Chaudhary Charan Singh, Shri Chandrasekhar, Shri H.D. Deve Gowda and Shri I.K. Gujral. Is the Karnataka a Preview of what the Congress and the Federal Front Promise for the Future?  https://t.co/BziYyOADN7 \u092a\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u0930\u0925\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u092c\u0927\u093e\u0908 \u0964 \u091c\u092f \u091c\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0925 ! #RathYatra https://t.co/Q9xRUe408c The present model of growth benefits all \u2013 irrespective of religion, caste or community.  The Congress provided India\u2019s poor with slogan. Prime Minister @narendramodi has given them resources. This will ensure faster growth for all and lead to a faster depletion in the poverty. India\u2019s fast pace growth story is likely to continue as per assessment of all credible agencies. Obviously, a high trajectory growth leads to a higher revenue. PM @narendramodi has shaken the traditional thinking process &amp; ensured that rural India get the first right of resources The other social welfare programmes of the Government are intended to benefit the weaker sections and those living in the rural areas are the prime target of these benefits. The success of the Jan Dhan programme has connected each home to the banks. The unprecedented resources sanctioned to rural India will bring a fundamental change in the quality of life in rural India. Every farmer to extend his activities from agriculture to dairy, animal husbandry, fisheries, to get the benefit of farm insurance, to get a higher MSP. In the current year, the total amount to be spent for livelihood and infrastructure in rural areas, both from the Budget, extra-Budget and non-budgetary resources, is Rs.14.34 lakh crores. This year alone it will provide to rural India, 321 crore person days of employment. Ever since PM @narendramodi took over, the Government\u2019s own yardstick for performance has become stiffer. Prime Minister is a man of many words &amp; many more actions. He announces stiff targets and programmes &amp; follows it up with the actual implementation and delivers the promise. India being the fastest growing economy for the last four years, we can look at the next decade as one of economic expansion. We have already seen a significant move up in India\u2019s ranking in the ease of doing business and as a preferred investment destination. Recently released World Bank data reveals that India has now become the 6th largest economy relegating France to the seventh position. If we keep growing at the rate which is being projected, it is likely that next year we will be the 5th largest economy ahead of Great Britain.

May God bless him with good health, and a long life. @rajnathsingh RT @narendramodi: Wonderfully written by @arunjaitley Ji, highlighting Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee's commitment towards a strong and united\u2026 In the past 70 years, we have witnessed a change in the situation- Pt. Nehru thought that a demand for \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d could incite a war, thus must be prohibited. On the contrary, we all were told that to advocate a breakup of the country without inciting violence is legitimate. The major paradox today is that the essence of this amendment was that a mere speech advocating \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d or of united India is a threat to the country, it can be an incitement to a war and, therefore, any talk of the same could be prohibited. Dr. Mookerjee, on the contrary, claimed that Pakistan wanted a war and was already at war with us having captured a part of our legitimate territory of Jammu and Kashmir and, therefore, to suggest that his speeches on \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d would lead to a war was not acceptable. Dr. Mookerjee spoke extensively in Parliament &amp; outside opposing the pact and advocating his philosophy in brief of \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d. Pt.Nehru over-reacted to his criticism. He interpreted the very idea of \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d as an invitation to conflict with Pakistan. Two days before the signing of \u201cNehru-Liaquat Pact\u201d in April, 1950, Dr. Mookerjee, who was Industry Minister in the First Cabinet as a Hindu Mahasabha representative, resigned from the Cabinet in protest and took strong public position against the \u201cNehru-Liaquat Pact\u201d. As we pay homage to Dr. Mookerjee today, I recall a forgotten chapter where his advocacy of \u2018Akhand Bharat\u2019 let Pt. Nehru to amend the Constitution restricting Dr. Mookerjee\u2019s free speech. The nation remembers Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee \u2013 an eminent Parliamentarian, a statesman and the Founder President of the Jan Sangh, as an alternative ideological pole, on his birth anniversary today. On Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee\u2019s Anniversary \u2013 How Pt. Nehru\u2019s intolerance towards Dr. Mookerjee\u2019s views led to a Constitution Amendment Restricting Free Speech. https://t.co/TMhl2AbitE Given the fact that since several versions of this judgement have appeared in the public space, I hope those who want to contribute to the public debate would read the judgement before commenting on it. The opinion of the court gives due importance to the opinion of the elected State Government but maintains the primacy of the Central Government in the larger interest of the national capital. However, if there is an exercise of power by the Central legislature in relation to these powers with respect to National Capital Territory of Delhi, it will override the authority of the Delhi State legislature. The SC has clearly observed that elected State Govt. will have the executive and the legislative authority in relation to powers under List II &amp; III of the Constitution. The Central Government simultaneously will also have authority to legislate in relation to these powers. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on 4th July settled the law with regard to allocation of legislative and executive powers between the elected Delhi Government and the Central Government alongwith the administrator-LG of the Union Territory of Delhi. What the Supreme Court has actually observed\nin the Delhi Government case? https://t.co/ab3NXiT5sb Birthday greetings to Shri  Ram Vilas Paswan ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet. May God bless him with a long &amp; healthy life, and success in all his endeavours. @irvpaswan Considering the large provisioning made in the Budget for food subsidy, the Government will be able to absorb the additional expenditure without breaching the fiscal deficit target. Added to the social sector and infrastructure investments in the rural areas, the revised MSP will go a long way to raise the quality of life in rural India. Govt. initiative in raising the MSP of 14 agriculture crops   will enrich and empower the farmer. \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u093e\u0928\u0902\u0926 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u092e\u0928\u0964 #SwamiVivekananda https://t.co/310tOyZYXV Saddened by the loss of lives in the tragic bus accident in Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand. My thoughts and prayers are with families who lost their dear ones. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured. The biggest success of #GST has been that the GST Council has proved to be an extremely effective &amp; powerful decision making federal institution.  The Finance Ministers\u2019 of the States have created history in the matter of federal governance. Key future actions in GST will include further simplifying and rationalizing the rate structure and bringing more products into the GST. I am confident that once revenue stabilizes and the GST settles, the GST Council will look into these carefully and act judiciously. The UPA kept petroleum products permanently outside GST.  On the contrary, we brought them back into the Constitution as levyable to GST and can gradually impose the GST when the GST Council so decides.  For this I would continue to make my earnest efforts with the States. The seamless flow of goods and services across the country has made \u2018Doing of Business\u2019 simpler. The GST is expanding the tax base of the less developed consuming states significantly, which will provide more resources for them to devote for development purposes. Rahul Gandhi has been advocating a single slab GST for India.  It is a flawed idea.  A single slab GST can function only in those countries where the entire population has a similar and a higher level of paying capacity. It has been one year since the country\u2019s switchover to a new indirect taxation system - the Good and Services Tax.  One single tax replaced seventeen taxes and multiple cesses imposed by the Central and the State Governments. #GSTForNewIndia THE GST EXPERIENCE https://t.co/VY5eNavDq8 1st July 2017 marked the introduction of #GST in India, a historic &amp; game changer reform. #GSTAtOne year has resulted in increased formalisation and greater tax compliance. On this landmark day, I convey my best wishes to people, state governments &amp; officials. Best wishes to Shri Manoj Sinha ji, my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers. May he be blessed with good health, healthy life &amp; a successful year head. @manojsinhabjp I convey my best wishes to Shri Kalraj Mishra ji on his birthday. May God bless him with good health and a long life. @KalrajMishra Birthday greetings to Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu ji, hon\u2019ble Vice-President of India. May God bless him with a long, healthy &amp; successful life. @MVenkaiahNaidu Any illegal depositor in Swiss Bank knows that it is a matter of months before his name becomes public and he will be subjected to the harsh penal provisions of the Black money law in India. Switzerland has amended its domestic laws involving all disclosures and entered into a treaty even with India and real time flow of information with regard to Indians will be made.  The flow of information is starting in January, 2019. Higher tax collection would enable us to continue with the developmental programmes in the country, not to impose any extra burden on the taxpayers and yet maintain the targeted fiscal deficit. This unprecedented taxation growth is a result of a number of measures adopted by the government including - the anti-black money measures, use of technology, demonetisation and the GST.  Most of these measures were severely criticized by the Congress Party. India\u2019s tax to GDP ratio in four years increased by almost 1.5%. On the contrary, a large number of taxpayers in each of the four Budgets of the present Government has benefitted from relief given &amp; at the same time tax revenue has substantially increased owing to transparency.

When it dies there, no Constitution can save it and no judge can protect it. The CPI was an unashamed supporter of the Emergency.  Its political line was that Emergency was a war on fascism.  Though theoretically the CPI (M) was opposed to the Emergency and critical of it, but it was not an active participant in the struggle against the Emergency. The 44th Constitution Amendment reversed most of the provisions of the 42nd Amendment but the evolution of technology has been the most significant development today. It has made censorship of the media impossible. You could no longer withhold information from the people. The most disturbing observation of the Emergency was, when the Central Government turned dictatorial, the entire system caved in.  The Supreme Court became subservient, the media became sycophantic. Mrs. Gandhi had accused Jagjivan Ram of betrayal.  She charged him for not informing her during the Emergency as to what was going wrong. A powerful and a crafty orator Babuji responded at this rally by saying: \u201c\u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 ? \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u091c\u0917\u091c\u0940\u0935\u0928 \u0915\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0964\u201c After almost 19 months of Emergency, when Atalji stood up to speak at the Ramleela Maidan, he was cheered for several minutes.

The Emergency Revisited \u2013 Part-3 (3-Part Series)- How it Ended? https://t.co/WqPqKRBfvU Birthday greetings to Shri Dharmendra Pradhan Ji, my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers. May he be blessed with good health, long life, and a successful year ahead. @dpradhanbjp The common man who did not understand the political consequence of dictatorship, understood it because of forced sterilization. As someone aptly put: \u0926\u093e\u0926 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0930\u094d\u0926-\u090f-\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0940, \u0938\u0930 \u0915\u091f\u093e \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0928\u0938 \u0915\u091f\u093e \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 l The Lesson from the Emergency is that if you curb free speech and allow only propaganda, you become the first victim of propaganda because you start believing that your own propaganda is the truth and the full truth. The then AICC President, Devakanta Barua proclaimed \u201cIndira is India and India is Indira\u201d. In a letter to Mrs. Gandhi from his detention JP wrote \u201cDo not equate yourself with the nation. India is immortal, you are not\u201d. The Representation of People Act was retrospectively amended to insert those provisions so that the invalid election of Mrs. Gandhi could be validated by changes in law.  Unlike Hitler, Mrs. Gandhi went ahead to transform India into a \u2018dynastic Democracy\u2019. Both Hitler &amp; Mrs. Gandhi never abrogated the Constitution.  They used a republican Constitution to transform democracy into dictatorship. Hitler arrested most of the opposition Members of Parliament &amp; converted his minority Government in Parliament into a 2/3rd majority govt. Mrs. Gandhi's imposition of Emergency under Article 352, suspension of fundamental rights under Article 359 and her claim that \u201cdisorder was planned by the opposition in the country\u201d, echoed Hitler's \u201cReichstag\u201d episode as exposed by the Nuremberg trials after 13 years The press was completely terrorized. Most editors &amp; journalists surrendered &amp; reconciled with the Idea of living in dictatorship.  The Congress Party newspaper \u201cNational Herald\u201d editorially commented that time had come for India to evolve into a single party democracy. During Emergency an atmosphere of fear &amp; terror prevailed in the country. Political activity had come to a grinding halt. The dissenters were mainly political workers of the opposition party &amp; the RSS. They kept repeatedly organizing Satyagrahas &amp; courted arrest. The Emergency Revisited \u2013 Part-2 (3-Part Series) - The Tyranny of Emergency https://t.co/xy80Imvbho The June 25-26 emergency proclamation suspended the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitution.  Every Indian was now devoid of this fundamental right. On the mid night of 25th and 26th June a fresh proclamation was got signed by the President on a state of internal emergency. Simultaneously with the proclamation under Article 352, another proclamation under Article 359 was issued. A dangerous thesis was propagated by the then Law Minister H.R. Gokhale &amp; Steel &amp; Mines Minister Mohan Kumaramangalam that judiciary must follow the social philosophy of the Government and judges must be appointed on the basis of their social philosophy. The years 1971 &amp; 1972 were high points in the political career of Smt. Indira Gandhi but due to economic mismanagement, inflation in 1974 touched a staggering 20.2 percent &amp; reached 25.2 percent in 1975. The Emergency Revisited \u2013 Part-I (3-Part Series) - The Circumstances Leading to the Imposition of Emergency https://t.co/AzG3EgS9RQ Political adventurists in parties like AAP, TMC &amp; the likes only look for a political opportunity in these groups.  Such groups are an over-ground face of the underground. Our policy has to be \u201cSave the Human Rights of every Indian \u2013 be it a tribal or a Kashmiri\u201d from terrorists. Even though the Congress Party historically &amp; ideologically would have been opposed to these groups, they have earned a sympathy in Rahul Gandhi\u2019s heart. He had no qualms about joining those who raised subversive slogans at JNU and Hyderabad. The Maoist don\u2019t allow development activity in tribal regions where they have a presence.  They kill innocent tribals who don\u2019t agree with them; they destroy public buildings; they kill security personnel and they even charge a parallel tax from helpless citizens. For the past three years the terrorists up their activities in the months of April, May and June so that the economic lifeline of the valley suffers in the tourism season.  They terrorise courts; they kill editors; they kill innocent citizens. In the State of J&amp;K, who is threatening the human rights of the citizens?  The entire Kashmiri pandit community has been banished from the State.  Initially spared but after the Chittissinghpura Massacre in the year 2000, most of the Sikh community has moved out. Who Is Threatening Human Rights? https://t.co/dPbihRlFQl #InternationalYogaDay greetings to everyone https://t.co/Xw2VNA4cSi Thank you Arvind https://t.co/m2IHc9Psw9 @arvindsubraman The economy &amp; the markets reward structural reforms, fiscal prudence, and macro-economic stability. They punish fiscal indiscipline and irresponsibility. The transformation from UPA\u2019s \u201cpolicy paralysis\u201d to the NDA\u2019s \u201cfastest growing economy\u201d, conclusively demonstrates this. Expenditure on rural projects has increased in a big way. The social sector schemes, more particularly the financial inclusion programmes have created a wave of self-employment. Each one of these is a high job creating sector. Evidence shows India growing &amp; stable on all indices. Experts say, the trend of India as the fastest growing global economy is likely to continue for next few years. With structural reforms like demonetisation, implementation of GST &amp; enforcement of the IBC, Indian economy is moving steadily ahead &amp; empowering every citizen. An analysis of data clearly shows that the construction sector is expanding by double digits. It is a job creating sector.  Investment is increasing. Domestic investment is also increasing. The FDI is at an unprecedented level. The IBC is unlocking the value in the NPAs. The Economy and the Markets Reward Structural Reforms and Fiscal Prudence  https://t.co/UQlrJOvLZ0 On the occasion of Eid-al-Fitr, my best wishes to everyone. May the Eid festivities foster peace, and brotherhood in the society. #EidMubarak The killing of Shujaat Bukhari, a respected editor, along with the kidnapping and killing of a soldier are highly condemnable acts.  My sympathies for the bereaved families. @rssurjewala surely the journey from India being part of the \u2018fragile five\u2019 and \u2018policy paralysis\u2019 to the world\u2019s fastest growing economy could not be result of economic mismanagement- Another case of ignorance. @rssurjewala - this is a political discourse. Abuse is not the answer. Please respond to the facts. P. Chidambaram believes that frying pakodas does not create jobs. Rahul Gandhi says that running Dhabas can be a launch pad for start ups. In dynastic parties political positions are heritable, wisdom is not. It opportunistically supported reservation for the non-backwards.  It impliedly wants to reduce the quota for the OBCs knowing fully well that the judiciary will not allow 50 percent cap on reservations to be waived and the new claimants would eat into the OBC quota. The Congress Party has been always anti-OBC. Late Shri Rajiv Gandhi made strong speech in Parliament against the Mandal Commission.  Recently, the Congress Party opposed the grant of constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes. They voted against. The UPA during 2008-2014 indiscriminately lent money through banks to these fifteen big defaulters. The Congress Party President prefers the Gobbelian traditions to say the exact opposite. What he claimed before the audience is precisely what we have successfully implemented. Recent statements of Congress leaders show lack of ideological pattern. Ignorance with anti-Modism is a common thread. Dynastic political parties are family &amp; personality dominated. Ideology takes a back seat and ignorance flourishes. Is Congress Becoming Ideologyless?  Is Anti-Modism its only ideology? https://t.co/YRHKRy0Uyt Birthday greetings to Shri @PiyushGoyal ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet.

May God render peace to the departed soul and strength to the bereaved family. Om Shanti. The \u201chalf Maoist\u201d is a serious threat to Indian democracy. Willingly or otherwise, they become over-ground face of the underground. Unfortunately some political parties see the Maoist as their instrument in the anti-NDA cause. It\u2019s high time that people recognise this malaise. With sincere efforts of the government led by PM @narendramodi ji a systemic problem in real estate sector has been resolved. Now homebuyer would not be the worst sufferer and he gets relief from the triple whammy. The RERA impact and the push by new ordinance would  catalyse the process of real estate development further. The \u201cfly by night\u201d operators would be eliminated. Projects would be completed in reasonable time and investors would get their share of allotments expeditiously. The NDA Government has fulfilled wishes of lakhs of home buyers/allottees through the IBC Ordinance 2018 by giving them status of financial creditor. With this they can initiate a corporate insolvency for a resolution against the errant developer and get their due. The IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 and the Homebuyer\nhttps://t.co/C6VBfLjs0V In a historic first Modi government enacted Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code to tackle massive NPA problem left up by the UPA government. The efforts of NDA government are bringing this lost money back to the system. Madhya Pradesh had the worst set of roads in India when the Congress was voted out in 2003. People of MP recognize revolution brought in by the Gram Sadak Yojana under leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji &amp; CM @ChouhanShivraj ji. Measures taken by PM @narendramodi ji for welfare of Farmers, betterment of economy and for benefit of every citizen of India are globally acknowledged. Mr. Rahul Gandhi must check facts before stating the reverse which will only aggravate his party's fallibility. Shri @RahulGandhi 's speech in Madhya Pradesh today reaffirmed my curiosity with respect to the question \u2013 How much does he know?  is he being inadequately briefed or is he being a little too liberal with his facts? How Much Does He Know? https://t.co/sCwT77f5Pt Delighted to be back at Home. My gratitude to the Doctors, Nursing officers and the paramedics who looked after me for over the past three weeks. I wish to thank all well-wishers, colleagues and friends who were very concerned and continued to wish me for my recovery. A \u2018Langar / Bhandara\u2019 are amongst the greatest of religious/ cultural practices. Delighted that we have made the food inputs cheaper by reimbursing the GST/IGST\u2019s central government\u2019s share. Congratulations to the Ministry of Culture for this great initiative. Financial inclusion of women, SC/ST, minorities and other weaker sections, unparalleled infrastructure development, fiscal consolidation &amp; securing rights of all sections of society have been highlights of the 4 years of transparent government led by PM @narendramodi ji. India is fast transforming from a tax non-compliant society to a tax-compliant society.  The enactment and implementation of #GST, the impact of demonetisation, effective tax compliance are all steps against black money, steps which are formalising the Indian economy. Ten years of the UPA rule had unquestionably witnessed the most corrupt Government since Independence.  PM @narendramodi ji created transparent systems through legislative and institutional changes which have given our country a scam-free governance. In the last 4 years leadership of PM @narendramodi ji has transformed India from being a part of the \u201cfragile five\u201d to a \u201cbright spot\u201d on the global economic scene. A regime of policy paralysis has been transformed into one of decisions and actions. My Reflections on the NDA Government after Completion of Four Years in Power https://t.co/DLug530w7c Congress Party\u2019s efforts of a \u201cforum shopping\u201d having failed, it refused to argue its unarguable case on merits.  Such misadventures donot behove of an old political party to deviate from the mainstream and take such fringe position. False hallucinations of Congress Party in Judge Loya case has already been exposed where it concocted the unnatural death theory. Now it wanted a continuing sword to hang on the CJI &amp; hence on the Apex Court. Congress Party\u2019s latest misadventure against the judiciary has been the impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of India was wholly misconceived.  It is poorly drafted and lacked in substance. On economic reforms, the Congress Party takes a position hostile to any reform measure and wants to go back on the retrograde policies. Congress Party, which occupied centre-stage once, is being pushed to the fringe.  It is not only electoral arithmetic that it occupies the fringe position but also the position that it adopts on several mainstream issues.

I would like to congratulate all Taxpayers, Hon\u2019ble Members of the GST Council, State and Central Government tax administration for this achievement With the improved economic climate, introduction of e-way bill and improved GST compliance, GST collections would continue to show a positive trend GST collections in April exceeding Rs. 1 lakh crore is a landmark achievement and a confirmation of increased economic activity as brought out by other reports Labour Day greetings to every workman.

The Parliament is supreme in its own jurisdiction.  Its process cannot be subjected to judicial review. Any political analyst could visualise that the impeachment motion would never get support of two-third majority in both Houses of Parliament.  The Congress Party knew this. So, the object was not the passage of the Motion but intimidation of India\u2019s judiciary. The Congress Party is capable of dragging the judges into an unsavoury controversy and make them controversial, should their judicial opinion not appear favourable in the cases in which the Party has an interest. Hearsay and rumours are not a substitute for evidence required for a motion to impeach CJI.  The present impeachment motion has been filed on untenable grounds.  It has been filed for collateral purpose to intimidate the CJI and other judges of the highest judiciary. The misconceived motion for the impeachment of the CJI is just one example of the growing tendency of lawyer-Members of the Parliament to drag intra court disputes into the parliamentary process to help different interests. Why the Malafide Impeachment Motion was bound to fail? https://t.co/47vLlySUR8 Saddened by the demise former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court Justice Rajinder Sachar. He was an activist judge &amp; wonderful person. My condolences &amp; prayers are with the bereaved family. May God render peace to the departed soul. Om Shanti. Impeachment should not be allowed to be used as political tool. If intimidatory tactics of \u201cInstitution Disruptors\u201d and impeachment motion are threats to judicial independence, the single greatest threat is the divided court itself Over the last few years one has witnessed the evolution of some public interest crusaders graduating into \u201cInstitution Disruptors\u201d. They pick-up even false causes and pursue the falsehood with a sense of deep commitment, indulge in intimidating advocacy &amp; justice dispensation. It has shaken democratic conscience that national political parties, a few retired judges and some senior lawyers so closely identified themselves with the generation of falsehood that they almost come out as conspirators. The Supreme Court judgment in Judge Loya case has exposed every fact of the conspiracy to generate falsehood as propaganda in the public and political space. Judge Loya Death Case \u2013 The One That Almost Created a Judicial Mutiny https://t.co/YkHLoGP0Vv Saddened by the demise of veteran journalist &amp; a good friend Shri TVR Shenoy.
