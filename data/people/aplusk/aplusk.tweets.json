This isn't a conservative or liberal debate it's about politicians representing their personal interests and not their community. #uberNYC Until the impact of ALL 2.7m vehicles are considered, any cap imposed on new for-hire vehicles remains completely arbitrary Here are the facts @BilldeBlasio make a data driven decision!!!! http://t.co/pG3meiK13Q Vote to keep #Uber moving in New York The residents of New York need access to affordable and reliable transportation. Why does this bill completely ignore the impact of buses, bicycles, pedestrians and of course yellow and green cabs on NYC roads? If slow average speeds in Manhattan is something that needs to be fixed, why did the city LOWER the speed limit thru Vision Zero this year? Limiting new for-hire vehicle licenses and taking away jobs from New Yorkers is not the answer.
