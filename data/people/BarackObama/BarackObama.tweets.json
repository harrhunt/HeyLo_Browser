Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election\u2014candidates who\u2019ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly.

Sometimes we\u2019ll agree and sometimes we won\u2019t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn\u2019t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice\u2019s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear.

The millions of young people worldwide who\u2019ve organized and joined today\u2019s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it. Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C That\u2019s what Americans do when others are in need \u2013 we help. We give.

Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a Happy Valentine\u2019s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It\u2019s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them. Don\u2019t be sad it\u2019s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge. Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.

As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson\u2019s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what\u2019s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq I\u2019ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life\u2019s most persistent and urgent question: \"What are you doing for others?\" Let\u2019s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.

Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4 In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, and I\u2019ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody! I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn\u2019t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it. Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9 Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica.\u00a0https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I\u2019m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year. As 2018 draws to a close, I\u2019m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw There\u2019s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth.

And nice bracelet, by the way. https://t.co/NFy3LxZe3f As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we\u2019re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2 RT @ObamaFoundation: The Cares Family reaches across generational divides to reduce loneliness in the U.K. Hear more from Alex Smith, found\u2026 No jump shots.

Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours. America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight \u2013 and all who were inspired by George and Barbara\u2019s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AbjXUwCh6z Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today.

Tune in at https://t.co/GYkEOK8EuT. https://t.co/sOllDsDA1Z Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I\u2019m proud to share @MBK_Alliance\u2019s first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: https://t.co/dKLWPvrFPC Of course, @MichelleObama\u2019s my wife, so I\u2019m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise \u2013 one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who\u2019s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who\u2019ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend. Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won\u2019t come from one election alone \u2013 but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn Today is the day. Today, it\u2019s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better.

Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance. When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment \u2013 and make sure they\u2019re paid equally. When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen. Tomorrow\u2019s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot. Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP Elections matter.

Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX https://t.co/hWkFHqi49K We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun. The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There\u2019s no good excuse not to vote. Head over to https://t.co/zTCemnRMYV to check your registration, get your absentee ballot, and find out where to vote on November 6. https://t.co/LIQbltVJtz America is always at our best when we look out for each other.

They deserve your vote: https://t.co/NO5jnhX3XD From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/AVtuBPHdr2 The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out. The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith\u2014hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. https://t.co/FN794E7Cqs We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can\u2019t overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are.

We\u2019ll miss him. https://t.co/orEXIaEMZM This National Gun Violence Awareness Day, show your commitment to keeping our kids safe from gun violence. Then, for everyone we\u2019ve lost, take action to change our leadership and our laws until they reflect that commitment - no matter how long it takes. https://t.co/lraIwlQAgl We can never truly repay the debt we owe our fallen heroes. But we can remember them, honor their sacrifice, and affirm in our own lives those enduring ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for which generations of Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. https://t.co/pRxwmaMClL This Center is for the leaders of tomorrow who are ready to step up and build the world as it should be.

How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs. Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans. We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.
