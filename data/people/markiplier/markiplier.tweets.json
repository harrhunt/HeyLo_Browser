And I think I've already made an error in my last tweet because I just saw that it's the time between aftershocks and NOT the magnitude that's the determining factor. But again, I might be wrong and dumb. @Ninja It's mostly down to statistical probability. While it's nearly impossible to predict earthquakes there's a general correlation (after a large quake) that the chance of a larger quake occurring diminishes as the strength of the aftershocks decline over a certain period of time.

Hurt like hell but I laughed. FULL WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL VLOG \u2014&gt; https://t.co/1ekmB6nWCQ @pewdiepie You had nothing to do with this. Full stop.\n\nThe shooter, who should be forgotten to the ass-end of history, is only trying to create division. Anyone that believes or spreads the message that you were associated with this in any way is doing exactly what the shooter wants. Just heard about the terrorist attack in New Zealand. I have no idea what to even say anymore in the face of such senseless violence. I can\u2019t imagine what the families or the community in Christchurch are going through. If there\u2019s a way I can help, I will find it. So... apparently BARELY CONSCIOUS ME had the motherfucking YOUTUBER INSTINCT to pull out my phone and snap off some vlog footage that I ABSOLUTELY DON\u2019T REMEMBER.

Climate change. @septicjpeg @Tesla No, just honest praise for some damn good service. @cheekabeeeka oh no I\u2019m still dead for sure. Tweeting from hell atm Just want to say, Cincinnati @Tesla killed it with service today. Suspension issue was fixed same day, no hassle dropping off or picking up, and they exceeded my expectations across the board. Cincinnati has once again proven itself superior to everyone else in every way. Mark has died of dysentery. Cincinnatus is within sight! I can hardly believe it but it looks like all of our hard work and perseverance has finally paid off! The nightmares are behind us! Our goal is right on the horizon! WE\u2019RE GONNA MAKE IT!! Our electric wagon ran out of power.. we hooked up Henry to a large hamster wheel which is charging the battery a bit while Chica pushes from behind. If things get desperate enough Amy will have to pull it... these are truly trying times. Tis dawn on last day... we\u2019ve run out of food, run out of water, out of time... if we don\u2019t make it to Cincinnatus by sundown tonight, we will surely meet our untimely demise... https://t.co/VqSwynlBC0 I would to take a moment to really give an honest shoutout to the greatest series on YouTube EVER!! SETTLERS OF CATAN!! Made by the infallible and infinitely lovable @LordMinion777 I will be loyal to the #MignonArmy for the rest of my LIFE!! https://t.co/iJaHnJslgy #NewProfilePic https://t.co/xEIokL84Oa RT @LordMinion777: TUESDAY PODCAST TIME! Come join the fun with @markiplier @muyskerm and me! https://t.co/HRcGLyvAz2 RT @muyskerm: About to be live with @LordMinion777 and @markiplier for some peen stuff.\n\nhttps://t.co/IvZJqboI6V We\u2019ve somehow survived the dreadful winter of the Rocky Mountain pass. I managed to repair our wagon wheels by replacing the spokes with some spare squirrels and tree sap. Life uh finds a way. The journey continues but I fear that morale is at an all time low... I\u2019m desperate... https://t.co/qjsHAs9Pel ...that wasn\u2019t chocolate... Incredible news! I can hardly believe it but I found CHOCOLATE right here in the woods, just lying on the ground! Fate is finally smiling upon me! I woke up. Surprised. Hands cold. Can barely write. Using Chica\u2019s shed fur as underwear lining. Itchy... so... itchy... @cheekabeeeka This is everything I could have ever hoped for. RT @cheekabeeeka: @markiplier using those skills he\u2019s been practicing on the wagon trail https://t.co/eCRcL5uXiw ...I fear that this may be my last communication for quite some time. Quite some time indeed... Should we wake on the morrow, which I sorely doubt, I shall write again.\n\n...Henry looks to me when he suspects me unaware, licking his meaty chops... My dearest Y/N,\n\nWe\u2019ve made camp for the night. I know not where for a raven stole away our map and left us lost, wandering in the dark. I hear the bawl of the wolves in the night. The cold cuts through our makeshift shelter with contemptuous ease. Chica is eyeing me for food... We\u2019ve reached a river. Do we...? The suspension on our wagon just failed... The nights blur into days. My sundial says that it\u2019s the morn of the second day but it feels as though have been burdened by this endeavor for nigh on a fortnight. Supplies are running low and morale even lower. We haven\u2019t even crossed that half-way point... pray for us 3rd vomit... 2100 miles to go... this journey is truly cursed... Our exodus to the East to the mythical town of Cincinnatus has begun. I fear for our safety on the long hard journey ahead of us. Amy and Chica are holding strong yet Henry has already vomited twice within the first 30 minutes... We are truly forsaken already... https://t.co/8av3Oj9zJO @Ninja Looks good, wear it well! also RIP all of your towels lol @Ninja red hair you say... @ARCTIICLEE @schmoyoho https://t.co/HxjQi5rY09 @ARCTIICLEE @schmoyoho https://t.co/0PgYIoKn2O STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!

Thanks for being understanding. @CinemamindDavid For clarity, I made the thumbnail so this is entirely my fault. Will address as soon as I\u2019m able. @CinemamindDavid Just saw this!

It started so innocently with pajamas and pjorts but I\u2019ve really changed I\u2019m so sorry @easeIy Always with the layout changes and what have you. Anyway to reiterate I am not a baby let alone yours @easeIy Twitter gets confusing sometimes with the newfangled UI changes. @easeIy Did you tweet the right person? @easeIy I\u2019m not even a baby @easeIy I am 29 years old @easeIy I am not your baby I\u2019m back in the good ol u s of a.

Hugging Chica has been a good source of smiles :) @Jack_Septic_Eye Thank you man! It\u2019s already been a great one, lots of heartwarming stuff this morning. I know that there\u2019s very little joy to be had in a situation like this BUT... this honestly made me laugh really really hard. https://t.co/i5OhZnbBpA @attackonhowelll It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s always hard. It will always be hard. But it\u2019s worth it.\n\nAnd that distinction makes all the difference in the world. Going against your nature is a sheer act of willpower but realizing that you can make that choice is freeing. I am an introvert. And to my fellow shut-ins please hear me when I say this... Don\u2019t let your desire to be alone hinder your growth as a person. Social situations are a constant struggle for me but I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today if I didn\u2019t push out of my comfort zone. It\u2019s Vidcon time. Get ready for a whole lotta me Hey gang! Gonna be streaming A Way Out with Amy, stop by for way too many goofs and maybe a sneak peak of Henry! https://t.co/KSAd0smzqD @septic_booper @gianna_jolie_ Honestly, I probably would have been perfectly happy. I would have thought it to be the smart decision, pat myself on the back, and moved on never knowing what could have been. The future is uncertain and risks don\u2019t always pay off. But sometimes... that risk is worth everything. @gianna_jolie_ Engineering school was me going through the motions. I could have been a decent engineer and everyone thought me a fool for quitting. But I listened to my heart and took a risky step towards who I really wanted to be, and here I am now :) Don\u2019t just go through the motions in life. Make moves toward who you want to be. RT @ao__hoshi: I will always pick to save chica even if it's the wrong!\n.\n.\n\nAlso thanks for finally making me a mod lmao @markiplier https\u2026 Spread #buttlove all around the world Always believe in your butt @Zombiemold Haha a classic.

DM me an address to send the hair. Someone make me a sweet new \u201cMarkiplier is Exiled\u201d banner and icon. I will give you a tuft of Chica\u2019s hair in exchange. lol nvm decided to fucking finish this shit. No videos for another week, I\u2019m exiled I don\u2019t regret committing to this at all and I\u2019m still gonna sign every single one of the 35,000 calendars but realistically speaking some people are gonna have to wait a couple months before I can get to them all. Have only been able to get about 2.5k a day up until this point. Main problem is the sheer size of the order. The calendars weigh a total 8820 pounds in boxes of 40 across 14 pallets. I lug each box, open it, dump it, sign it, and repack it. Today was the first day I had a buddy. Got another 6-7 thousand signed today. Tomorrow\u2019s the last full day I have to sign, then I\u2019ll have to trickle them down a little bit each day for the rest of forever. Hands have fallen off so that\u2019s a problem. @MatthewSantoro @2Trentan You did? I haven\u2019t seen it! I never thought I\u2019d get tired of seeing myself naked but I am so incredibly done with my own ass I\u2019m not even half-way through the calendars. I\u2019m gonna die before I sign them all.

Ethan, you have a such a bright future ahead of you. Getting to know you and seeing your endless enthusiasm has been nothing short of inspirational. You haven\u2019t even begun to scratch the surface of what you\u2019re capable of and I can\u2019t wait to see you reach it. Tyler, I can\u2019t state in words how proud I am of you. To see you go from One-Word-Tyler to standing right alongside us as we tour our show across Europe is a feeling that I can\u2019t capture in a tweet but I hope you know it in your heart. #SmileAlways Wade, you have grown from a distant classmate to one of my closest friends and I hope you know how proud I am of how far you\u2019ve come. From the first computer we built together to me cracking up at every joke you make has been such a great privilege. Bob, you are intimidatingly funny. I knew from the first time we watched Brian Regan together that you and I were gonna be fast friends and I can say with full honesty I wouldn\u2019t be where I am if you didn\u2019t believe in the crazy ideas that spilled out of my mouth. My friends made me cry on stage tonight so this is payback. This might take a while so buckle up.

Even if you\u2019re not near Las Vegas donating blood is always a good answer! https://t.co/4LHlCzjiw8 I know this sounds awful but please be cautious when donating money to Las Vegas victims. Too often it never reaches those who need it most. @cheekabeeeka @MissRavenMonroe Read more on it, seems on the up-and-up but they\u2019re not ready to handle donations for this yet. Will keep searching. @cheekabeeeka @MissRavenMonroe They\u2019re a small organization with very little footprint but I\u2019ve tracked some endorsements and backings. Just want to confirm. @cheekabeeeka @MissRavenMonroe Does anyone have any experience with the National Compassion Fund? It seems to be the one meant specifically to getting money to victims. @cheekabeeeka @MissRavenMonroe Agreed. Sad to say, opportunists are dangerously prolific during tragedies.  I\u2019ll dig for a good one. @imfood_ That\u2019s sad of him. You may very well have saved a life. And I\u2019ll take, \u201cmight have saved one\u201d over \u201cwhat difference does it make\u201d any day. If you\u2019re looking for a way to help, please consider giving blood.

I remember collapsing down and crying at every single thing that reminded me of him. I had a dream that my brother died. It was the most intensely sad dream I've ever experienced.

Come one, come all to the Christmas charity livestream! https://t.co/iLFY0peHAx It's so good to be home! @OfficialJlipper probably tomorrow @BixLePro my throne is a pile of trash @flobethany naw loads of people have beaten it already. I'm late to the game @howellcanyounot FNAF 2 had 10 characters that were MUCH more chaotic IMO but then again it's been a while so time makes things hazy @EpiclyBorn yep! @Chlobob03 I pulled it out of the dumpster. It's got some moldy ramen on it but it's aight @flobethany umm... I don't really know. Probably around 100 attempts? @17blackee This one was really monotonous so not the most fun but then again I don't think I can call any of these challenges \"fun\" lol @look_up_here yeah but that's no excuse @SmolMatthewx Oh WAY easier. But not to say it's EASY. A lot of multitasking and focus required which is hard to do while sick :P Beat it! Total time about 7.5 hours. I'd rank it about 3rd most difficult 20/20/20/20 mode behind FNAF 1 and 2 @DyvyneNephilim I was too tired to rage lol. Just a lot of silence and coughing, I recorded that though for whatever it's worth :P Put ~6 hours into Golden Freddy mode, got pretty close (about 10 seconds away) but started feeling sick and sluggish. Will finish tomorrow! Wow the spammers aren't even trying anymore lol https://t.co/FjLFiIO1fq It's Christmas time at the office!
