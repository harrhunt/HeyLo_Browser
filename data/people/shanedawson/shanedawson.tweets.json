(6/?) now that im making stuff i love and im being myself it feels so much better and i finally feel like im putting stuff out into the world that means something. im not saying i hate everything ive made over the years (5/?) my goal with the podcast and with my videos years ago was to tell shocking stories that would make people laugh and scream \"OMG NO U DIDNT!!\" and think i was \"soooo crazy\". its embarrassing and i fucking hate myself for it. (4/?) that story was fake and was based on a dumb awful sketch idea I had years ago that i never made (THANK GOD) and when the opportunity came up for a funny moment in the podcast I told it as if it was a real story which was DISGUSTING and VERY VERY DUMB (3/?) ive apologized many times for all the dumb shit ive said in videos and podcasts over the years. ive learned my lesson over and over again and im more confident now in my ability to be entertaining by just being myself and not being so shocking for laughs.(2/?) i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself i wasnt going to make apology videos after last years thing so im just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible. (1/?)

Fuck it. For part 4, i\u2019m going full tea. no censoring. no holding back. no worrying about pissed off people texting me. You guys wanted tea and I\u2019m gonna bring the whole damn kettle. Grab on to your fuckin mops. taking a break from twitter for a while. ill let u guys know when the videos go up and when they are planned to go up. but besides that i\u2019m stepping away and i\u2019m gonna focus on making them. part 4 on wed and part 5 fri. \u2764\ufe0f @mikeboydvideo @SsjDeath it\u2019s offensive @sharingscars @FoldyHolds @contrashelby .\u2019m dealing with hate from so many people for so many reasons. can we save the political stuff for like... a month from now? haha @idolizingomez i didnt accuse anyone of anything. i observed. and yes, your childhood creates who you grow up to be. good or bad. me included. @mikeboydvideo $10 an hour editor remark was shitty. im fine with criticism but that comment was just shitty. to me and to the editors out there who are vastly underpaid and treated like shit that didn't sit well with me. @mikeboydvideo i apologized, changed things, added a disclaimer and apology to episode 3 and have done everything in my power to make people feel heard. im so tired. i dont know what else to do. @JohnPodzinski thanks man :)) @mikeboydvideo from looking at your pics it looks like you edit your own stuff too and know how hard it is to make something. i think its pretty shitty for you to make fun of it knowing how much working editing a video takes. @rossirvin11 @jakepaul who the fuck said i was perfect? @katiet121 @jamiewordsleyx no worries!! i never said my opinion on trump when i was with kathy. i kept that whole video very non political because i\u2019m not into politics. but no worries! \ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f @katiet121 @jamiewordsleyx i don\u2019t mean to sound rude but when have i ever talked about my political views? haha \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 https://t.co/WAJZhPO0gw @EltonCastee \u26f0\u26f0\u26f0\u26f0\u26f0\u26f0\u26f0hahhaa thanks man. i get it. and i don\u2019t wanna hold u back from opinions. just wanted u to know that i went into this with good intentions and being nice toward the family was important to me. and hard to balance @petermonn \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f @EltonCastee ya. it\u2019s been a true rollercoaster of emotions this week for me haha @EltonCastee @french_fry_23 u didn\u2019t watch the whole video. clearly. come on man. i said i wasn\u2019t gonna judge them until i met them or knew more about them from jake @RBlackCoyote i think maybe i just connected to it because as a youtube who is constantly being used for views the idea of a parent doing it hits me in a weird emotional place. but i very much said that she\u2019s not a bad person and that later we see more of her story. @RBlackCoyote they..... post..... videos....... of....... them.....hating on each other.....for public consumption....... i feel like it\u2019s important to show that. it says so much about jake and why he is who he is..... which was the point of the series. and a turning point for me personally @EltonCastee i was literally villainized for part 2. so the fact that you thought part 2 was better just makes me even more confused about what the fuck i\u2019m doing haha i just never know what people are gonna be mad at me for :/ YOU WARNED ME. THEY ALL WARNED ME. HELPPPPP https://t.co/Nw8JVUkrGi @neilcain1234 but thats....the.....point.... hahahaha but i understand! thanks for watching the first 3! &lt;3 @neilcain1234 wait what? that\u2019s the point. that\u2019s it\u2019s NOT ok. i\u2019m confused ... @EltonCastee @french_fry_23 that\u2019s not trueeeeeee \ud83d\ude29 @EltonCastee them posting hours of videos doing innapproptriate things and talking about each other PUBLICLY is something i\u2019m allowed to react to. nerdcity can do it but i can\u2019t? i literally said i\u2019m not gonna judge them until i meet them 3 times &amp; i was NICE about them \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude13 MY HEART \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/F0yuhA8XPD if i had a dollar for every text i\u2019ve gotten from one of jake pauls victims, enemies, or friends begging me to not mention them in the series i think i\u2019d enough to buy my own Team 10. :,) thank u \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/XHBgb63zKc ya. i debated not posting it because i thought people would think it was dragged out but it was a really important video to me. it was the day i started questioning everything too :/ https://t.co/QtO3fkPnJM \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude29 https://t.co/K8ZJzUGVvC Part 3 - The Family of Jake Paul\nhttps://t.co/aEYIpaAuNV https://t.co/vtncyyOoZB @elijahdaniel :,) \u2764\ufe0f @KEEMSTAR @jakepaul holy shit hahahaha \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s been a wild ride!! i\u2019m not gonna try and make anyone like anyone. my goal was and still is seeing why jake is the way he is. and we did that. TRUST ME. haha k back to editing! see u guys tomorrow! i\u2019m nervous! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c https://t.co/FmdMAibDxM thank u for trusting me. i\u2019m really really excited about this series and where it\u2019s gonna go. i\u2019m excited to be on this ride with you :,) matching face tattoos after? KIDDING.... kinda \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd73 https://t.co/wFF6faI6O4 RT @jakepaul: @shanedawson Life was so much easier on Vine life was so much easier when i was doing pizza slime galaxy videos YES! haha the collab i\u2019ve been waiting for! https://t.co/5XmKXcliq8 @NetNobody @rahafumatar @ilovemusic5685 i was told by a professional that the 2 words were the same. i should have been more careful about it and i apologize in tomorrow\u2019s video. i was just trying to make something cool. i wasn\u2019t trying to make people upset. but i\u2019m trying all i can to fix things :( @myendlesslou @NetNobody i know. it is what it is. i know my intentions are good and i know i\u2019m gonna get shit no matter what. but i\u2019m proud of it and i\u2019m excited for people to see where it all goes. \u2764\ufe0f @NetNobody it was something me and him both talked about and he was aware the whole time, which i\u2019m addressing. for me it\u2019s more of a study of why he is the way he is. the sociopath element was added because it can explain a lot and open up the conversation Part 3 Tomorrow. \nAn eye opening and very strange twist in events but I\u2019m really excited by how in depth and genuinely controversial the subject matter is getting. Not everything is easy to explain and sometimes you just have to dive deeper. \ud83d\udd73\ud83d\udd73\ud83d\udd73 https://t.co/sERuQoWnWQ As I edit I realize no matter what I do a big group of people are going to be pissed at me. Either people who hate jake, people who love jake, the mental health community, sociopaths or scariest of all.... the Paul family.\nHappy Sunday!! https://t.co/Vxm7KNFoMY monday :,) i\u2019m happy ur excited. i am too \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/BVmS99pges https://t.co/wYNermzIhl @shaycarl @jessicataylor_x @CharlesTrippy :((( love u \u2764\ufe0f @lexforchange @Aly_Sheehy of course. my heart just broke when i saw this. i\u2019m so sorry. \u2764\ufe0f @lexforchange @Aly_Sheehy the reality of the disorder in perspective. i blurred the footage but it still is obvious what it is. i\u2019m sorry if it hurt u to see it in my video. only love coming from my end i promise :( \u2764\ufe0f @lexforchange @Aly_Sheehy i\u2019m so sorry. i used footage of something that was unquestionably the most awful and heartbreaking news story i could from recent events to show the level at which someone with the disorder doesn\u2019t have empathy. i only used the news footage because it i thought it would put (1/2) CRAP. i meant Mon/Wed/Fri\n\nsorry i haven\u2019t slept haha \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/RxPoA1ijCT A JOEY MEME. thank u. i needed that today :,) \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/ik7E1nE4i9 Part 3, 4, &amp; 5 on Mon/Tue/Wed\nrefilming some stuff today to address the concerns of part 2. But i think it\u2019s a good thing  &amp; going to make the conversation better &amp; less dramatized. Jake will be in part 5! i know it feels like i\u2019m milking it but trust me, it was necessary. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udde0 https://t.co/gOcSh1aQk8 I wanna address some of the issues people had with episode 2 and i\u2019m figuring out how to do that today. in the meantime this was a great and eye opening video for me. check it out \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/XCZFeUgNSB :,))))) \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/4WGJtXqtOD @LoganPaul a surprise extended finale?! \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc41\ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/Nc5kKpSW70 @LeighBryan @jakepaul @AndrewSiwicki @KatiMorton interesting! i liked this episode better too. so i was shocked that some people were mad about it. but i\u2019m so fascinated by sociopaths. @moschicko how would you explain it? @rachelstarlive @itshayleybop @ZacharyJRose @jessesaintjohn then you aren\u2019t a sociopath. because sociopaths don\u2019t care about their safety. at all. they have a disregard for themselves and others. it\u2019s the main characteristic i understand why people are upset. i definetly went overboard with the horror movie editing but that\u2019s cause i got excited &amp; love editing horror. but i\u2019m going to be more sensitive with the editing going forward. the last thing i want it to hurt anyone. :(its never my intention. https://t.co/aNcXkJo5eI @rachelstarlive @ZacharyJRose @jessesaintjohn wait, are you an actual sociopath? cause i didn\u2019t see that tweet. i don\u2019t think you are right? because anhedonia is very very different. @rachelstarlive @jessesaintjohn rachel!! hi!i definetly didn\u2019t insinuate that having a mental disorder makes you toxic. but being an actual sociopath by definition is someone who would not be great to be in a relationship with. but i would NEVER insinuate that a mental disorder in itself would make anyone toxic super interesting video. i watched it when i was researching for the series. https://t.co/pDUM7MbXEt @jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon they are a couple so it\u2019s only fair to include her @jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon don\u2019t forget bella @jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon i genuinely think people are just having fun on twitter. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep. i mean, i used clips of tana mongeau. it ain\u2019t that deep. haha but i also do think people should be more aware. even if it\u2019s just them joking...at least they won\u2019t be so easy to manipulate \ud83d\ude2c @jessesaintjohn because at the end of the day sociopaths are real and almost every single movie talks about them and there\u2019s tons of articles online about it. all i did was put it on my channel and talk about something i\u2019m interested in because i\u2019ve been so hurt by them in the past. @jessesaintjohn in a world where we have a shooting daily and we have sexual assault all over it feels like telling people to be more vigilant isn\u2019t a bad thing. even if it causes a few people to freak out and say \u201cis my friend a sociopath?!\u201d on twitter and forget 2 hours later. seems worth it. @molls @jakefogelnest thanks guys!!!!! :,)))) @jessesaintjohn why is it bad to help the average person spot the signs just to be aware. not to diagnose. but to at least be aware. i wish i knew about it sooner. @jessesaintjohn teaching people how to spot the obvious signs is helping them get away from a toxic relationship and could even save them from having children with someone who doesn\u2019t actually care about them. or anyone @jessesaintjohn people with severe antisocial personality disorders don\u2019t have empathy and don\u2019t care. at all. so for anyone to be offended is so confusing to me considering they actually literally don\u2019t care. like. at all. and its something that is rarely even discussed and it can affect lives. @willdarbyshire thanks man!!!! @tanamongeau HAHAHAHAHSHSIAVWJSGWUVD @petercoffin \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f RT @tanamongeau: ok ill sob. i love you. wait that's an emotion. i'm confused. hahahahaha https://t.co/fafdZQYtk7 i tried to make it clear in the vid, the description, my twitter, &amp; all other places that people can\u2019t diagnose each other &amp;that a therapist needs to meet them. and also that it\u2019s not the obvious awkward kid it\u2019s someone you would never expect. people who fly under the radar \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/8i5dABGql8 RT @KatiMorton: @ldkmichelle @shanedawson Some know.. others don\u2019t. The truth of it is that even if they do know, they don\u2019t really care ei\u2026 @vajayjaysrock thank u!!!!! :'))) RT @LeonardusKun: @wolfkhid @rjkyes @iambean99 @nicoleicorn @tabathataylorr @shanedawson Thank you! There is a very negative stigma around\u2026 @kayceeook @tanamongeau HAHAHHAHAHA i love my daughter! interesting. im very curious to hear more from people diagnosed with ASPD. help me fall down more holes! tell me more! https://t.co/nbeSe8wOBo @MrBombPop @tarajoarcher @harto @KatiMorton sociopaths dont get \"help\". and if they do its RARE and only to keep them from hurting people. it has nothing to do with them dealing with their emotions cause they dont care. thats the point. i read 2 books about it and its very interesting. for even more info and a more in depth look check out @KatiMorton\u2019s video she posted today! https://t.co/VRbhuxO9oM @ArielleScarcell @melaniietweets \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/VMkVfoknzc @HarleyPlays \ud83d\ude02 @PhillyD @jakepaul @AndrewSiwicki @KatiMorton i also use it when she explains tanacon hahaha what an actual horror movie!
