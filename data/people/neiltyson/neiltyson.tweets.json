Due to some intriguing optical properties of reflection from textured surfaces, the Full Moon is 6x brighter than the Half Moon. @Alloyjane See earlier tweet on Tides. Always wondered why Werewolves transition only upon **noticing** the Moon is Full. Never in the basement, or when there\u2019s a Full Moon during a cloudy, overcast night. https://t.co/omWk5LX628 FYI: Full Earth seen from the Moon is about 60x brighter than full Moon on Earth. Earth is not only bigger in the sky, but with clouds and ice and oceans, much shinier than the Moon, itself about as reflective as the sidewall of a car tire. The Full Moon exerts no more gravity on you than does any other phase.\n\nSo Lunatics have no real excuse. The appearance of a huge Moon on the horizon, juxtaposed behind cityscapes or mountains or trees is called the Moon-on-Horizon illusion.  It\u2019s actually no bigger than when higher in the sky.\n\nYup. It really is just an illusion. Full Moon tonight.\n\nLittle Known Fact:: Tides raised on Earth by the Moon alone are roughly the same size no matter the phase. But at new &amp; full Moon, solar tides add to lunar tides, which is what makes them larger. https://t.co/n6NPgWcEIX If God wanted humans to explore Space, he would have given Earth a Moon. https://t.co/t5KTsStGsg Moon-week in my Twitter stream.

The Qur\u2019an says plainly that daytime fasting during Ramadan ends at \u201cDark\u201d not at sunset. \u201cDark\u201d is a good match for the end of twilight.

So Earth's jiggle is basically an orbit \u201caround\u201d the Moon. @napendergraph All depends on how fast you rotate. All slow-rotating galaxies, especially in galaxy clusters, are round.  And the huge Oort Cloud [Google it] of comets, surrounding the Sun and planets, is spherical. \u201cOn Being Round\u201d \u2014 Chap. 8 of **Astrophysics for People in A Hurry** discusses how the laws of physics conspire across the cosmos to prefer spheres.

Finally, inspired by @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, here\u2019s my list of the best Hollywood Aliens and why: https://t.co/dbifvoeDJU With next year\u2019s @SuperBowl 50 the NFL abandons Roman Numerals, leaving @StarWars as the last bastion of this counting system Both at age 19, my wife saw @StarWars in 1977 &amp; our daughter saw #TheForceAwakens in 2015. I don\u2019t know what that means. ( A Parsec is an obscure unit of distance in Astrophysics, equal to 3.26 Light Years. Neither has anything to do with time. ) Unashamed of inanity, #TheForceAwakens repeats the Millennium Falcon boast of completing the Kessel Run in \"under 12 parsecs\" In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the starry skies were unfamiliar. As they should be, a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, apparently Wookiees don\u2019t age, or they age much slower than human actors do. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the Storm Troopers still run as though they\u2019re carrying a full load of poop in their diapers. Never seen Romanescu Broccoli?  Fractal Earth food befitting a tale of long ago and far, far away. https://t.co/NZDkWpeqOB In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the lead character snacks on what includes Romanescu Broccoli, nature\u2019s only fractal food. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, once again I felt isolated and inadequate for not understanding Wookiee-speak. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here &amp; there. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, if you were to suck all of a star\u2019s energy into your planet, your planet would vaporize. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8, a smooth rolling metal spherical ball, would have skidded uncontrollably on sand. I guess I did just demote R2D2 to \u201cDwarf Cute\u201d status.  No hard feelings though. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8 is waaaaay cuter than R2D2. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, I\u2019m reminded that Red &amp; Blue teams cooperate with one another. Rare in American Politics.

For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA. In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area. If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie. Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings. @MikeonTV (What do you have against the Moon?) Nothing much would happen.

Especially when the cosmos serves as the artist's muse. What's the question? Okay two more legit Alien IDs: If you are of Mercury you are Mercurial. And if you are of Jupiter, by jove, you are Jovian. Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human \"of the Earth\" you are Terrable. (Just kidding, Earthlings) Want More? The Moon's Latinized name is Luna.  If you are \"of the Moon\u201d youre simply \u201cLunar\u201d.  Lunatics are something else.. Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are \"of the Sun\" you are simply \u201cSolar\u201d. Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - \u201cof Venus\u201d to all related diseases Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  \"of Ceres\". Gotta give you that one @elakdawalla.  If you\u2019re from the Dwarf Planet Ceres, you\u2019d surely be Cereal. https://t.co/e5SiAycXvD From Venus? Then you\u2019re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans.
