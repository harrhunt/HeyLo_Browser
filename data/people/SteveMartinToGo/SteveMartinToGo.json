Kansas City tomorrow! https://t.co/dB0yNa9vok Now, this has five retweets. https://t.co/OaZZJ55HSU I save it for the latter part of the show. Excitement builds for the audience. https://t.co/TA16BfKFls You are correct. I\u2019m going to Kansas City on Thursday. Sorry to excite a town prematurely. https://t.co/aCW7ITY4kk Oops. Kansas City. https://t.co/dDvuMi3lH1 Marty and I are coming to Wichita on Wednesday, Oklahoma City on Thursday. Yes, I will be doing the pointing gesture as seen in this photo. https://t.co/kJUkHifyni Today\u2019s cartoon from Harry and Steve. @Blisscartoons https://t.co/INpNnQuSRp Actor Steve Martin Amassed a Stellar Collection of Australian Aboriginal Art at Warp Speed\u2014and Now You Can See It at Gagosian | artnet News https://t.co/MHkJ1qFC2k Another cartoon from Harry and me. @Blisscartoons https://t.co/TctEOY6uPE You can see our collection of Indigenous Australian desert artists opening today at Gagosian Bookstore Gallery. https://t.co/YB90q4W0dT https://t.co/T8JUF5a6WU Here is today\u2019s cartoon from Harry Bliss and me. @Blisscartoons https://t.co/xECebBBZ7x Look out, Wichita and Kansas City. 8 &amp; 9th. https://t.co/MWU9uZQAql Our Australian tour is now announced! Starts in November in Perth. Look how cute we are. https://t.co/kfE7601Yf4 Marty and I are now preparing for Wichita and Kansas City.  Concerned over packing for unknown temperature. Could be sweater weather or shirt-sleeves. Still, temperature in hotel room is a variable.  There\u2019s only so much room in 12 suitcases. https://t.co/sPT88jSWZG We are so excited! Which means we have to be excited for five months. https://t.co/WLECH1d1E4 Another cartoon from Harry Bliss and me. \u2066@Blisscartoons\u2069 https://t.co/giOGq9VtDM \u201cT\u201d Just finishing the \u201cfar.\u201d https://t.co/OmIWmKprHy Ugh. Not complaining, just finishing the \u201ctho.\u201d Working on it! https://t.co/vdr2ZHyFDB Busy night for Steve even though I\u2019m just sitting here. https://t.co/ZfBKHW85Pe I\u2019m moving to Australia just so I can watch it! https://t.co/D2SG1BEy1R Today\u2019s cartoon from Harry Bliss and me. \u2066@Blisscartoons\u2069 https://t.co/NqlPqUHQA5 I have realized that on this tour, Marty and I are only playing cities that are fun to say. Rochester is certainly fun to say, so is Waukegan. Kansas City, perhaps, is not AS fun to say, still, one would have to be very jaded to say it\u2019s not fun at all. https://t.co/BJ8MYaye3o Retweet, lose comma after first Wichita. https://t.co/OTHOzB9RQL Coming to Wichita, and Kansas City soon. \u201cWichita\u201d very fun to say; \u201cKansas City\u201d less fun to say, but very self-explanatory. https://t.co/jwOSSdZiad You might enjoy this painting by the American 19th Century painter Frederic Church. 5.6 by 9.5 feet. Argh. So hard to correct a typo on Twitter. https://t.co/iAXHgROBCw Be sure to see Marty and me in Wichita on May 8th! https://t.co/xXHC9WAAEP Next stop, Wichita!
