I am terrible @MissInformation I have tears in my eyes all day, ready to go. This sums it up so well. I\u2019m sorry you feel this way, too. It will get better \u2764\ufe0f @JTFC_TM @oliviawilde @Pornhub this is true dammit it\u2019s gotta be a too-real parody.

Like full doggy but no lesbian kissing is a rule? Lame AND he had to fly on his least favorite airline. That is love I do not normally brag about john, as it is my schtick to make fun of him always, but he flew from London to LA instead of London to DC to have dinner with me and watch love island UK because I haven\u2019t been feeling like myself lately. Just a few hours but it meant a lot. Thank u I\u2019ve never seen the words \u201cpasses away\u201d in reference to a notorious serial killer. I think I prefer \u201cis dead\u201d https://t.co/hUAGWLKr6q But also, I\u2019m glad you are having fun, I really am. I\u2019ve just never seen one THIS LONG Also acceptable: night before Halloween. Because there is a lot on Halloween. But from LAST WEEK TIL NOW??? No!!! No You know when my Halloween party night is? Halloween. I have never seen a longer Halloween in my life. @CanadianSugars I feel fuzzy now! It\u2019s all good I was being bitchy too. For the record it\u2019s an absolutely terrible show @CanadianSugars Me too this is stupid.

I...I love it. God dammit i can\u2019t be held captive to another show. I need to take care of my kids @jonronson I delete recent stupid tweets when I buckle into a flight so the last one isn't in the story when we crash and die. I barely think about the death part. just the article. @rgay WHO on earth would even have the balls @APdubs I remember that! Lol @jasperlbeckmen Really? I feel like it\u2019s sadder @JayNedaj I cried a tear at 1:06. I\u2019m a wreck lately If I bring candy to your neighborhood and give it to u before, will you hand it to my kids and pretend today is Halloween Any neighborhoods do trick or treating early for kids?

My Snapchat emoji was a pizza. Get it right!! https://t.co/TTEDdlkeEg We started picking a word of the night during dinner and asking google to play us the word! last night was \u201capplesauce\u201d and your song popped up. we loved it! \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/145rCyDmvi It was happening before for a while - I think posting my kid\u2019s Halloween costumes may have started it. But shit hit the fan when our flight got turned around. Which uh, had nothing to do with us, and that i literally live tweeted. Why I would \u201clive tweet\u201d me being a pedo, I dunno https://t.co/rVGzAew7oE @PokerPolitics yes so imagine the INSANITY when I posted my daughter in a Halloween hot dog costume HOOOOOOOOboy it was a SIGN @AlyndaWheat yeah that has proven not to be true. I can\u2019t ignore them. They aren\u2019t trolls. They believe my husband and I traffick kids. I have pictures of them in my garage.

Didn\u2019t put words in your mouth. Have it all here. Goodnight, sick darling. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Oh so I\u2019m also a pedo for hating the president and calling him a pussy ass bitch. that\u2019s what it really comes down to. you wouldn\u2019t give two fucks about any of this if I supported trump. it\u2019s so fucking beyond odd, your delusions. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Ok. Expose it already and enough with the fucking \u201cSOON\u201d shit so you can leave me and my family the fuck alone @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Now you get to talk about how crazy I am. Because you finally cracked me. Congrats. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer If I say so? There is really no helping you people. I\u2019ve really tried with you. Just go now. I hope through this you\u2019ve at least seen you\u2019re talking to a real life breathing human being that has to read, from you and your people, that I molest fucking kids all day. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer I can\u2019t fucking win. And I don\u2019t want to anymore. Can you imagine being in my shoes for a minute? I have a life and a family. What you do to me is sick but I\u2019m still aware enough to know it\u2019s not as horrible as what you think is really happening. And what IS happening. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer I don\u2019t understand the \u201cHollywood is a driving force in the market\u201d part. I want to say that isn\u2019t true but the truth is, no one KNOWS if it\u2019s true. So I won\u2019t. My old tweets are just that and they were always in reference to something else you guys want to take out of context @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast Yeah. We fucking aren\u2019t. But when you tweet it with conviction, I guess we are. @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e A cop out to acknowledge it happens everywhere? What can I do to satisfy you? It seems like nothing and you know it. And what do you mean \u201cif\u201d? Human trafficking IS happening all around us. And the right people fucking care. @jonrosenberg SCREENSHOTTING THIS INCREDIBLY SARCASTIC TWEET IN CASE IT GETS DELETED @GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e this type of shit happens EVERYWHERE. right fucking next to YOU. It\u2019s ALL terrible. You think this is restricted to Hollywood?? You leave your fucking house more than I do, I promise. @jonrosenberg Oh my god. Jesus take me now @dasquidnamedsyd Currently rolling in a ball in front of me! @CigarDaisy311 @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast I swear to god i will do this one at a fucking time. I am so done. @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e TELL ME. go the fuck on, by all means. Keep fucking going. @CigarDaisy311 @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast All good. I know. I\u2019m just so fucking tired of this shit. Not defending yourself doesn\u2019t work. Defending yourself doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d rather get to talk. @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast If I go out, I take 10-20 pics with random people a day/night. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re up to. I think I saw Harvey 3 times in 14 years, out and in public only. But they use this, over and over and over. @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We didn\u2019t know. We wish we could take it back with what we know now\u201d does not work for these people. this wasn\u2019t done in secrecy. What do you want from us. It\u2019s a photo. A 1 second in time party pic they use over and over and over to accuse us of molesting children. @alliehagan Lol yes! I love sport @LisaMariePosso whaaaat @alexisssotelo \ud83d\ude02 it makes me so happy to know people really thought I saw Lebron James at an embroidery shop in downtown LA with a blank jersey @juristired I feel like maybe it was a livestream or something.

Good to know! @BuckyIsotope Let me know! @miraclenoodle That is so kind but I have so much! thank you though! @CruzanChoklate this was me, all the time. Look how I turned out! (not sure) what in the https://t.co/OXFbJeLySZ @Romanram0s @WelshGriffiths u better change your username for this day, buddy @TheJoeRoy no @WelshGriffiths the standards....are low lol I know this sounds crazy, but this is actually the most rational response I've gotten from a Q person. I'm not upset by it. if you believe all this, this is a legitimate question/statement. Hi. I do not know how to tell you that I do not know the answer to this. I sit on my couch, I take care of my kids, work and I cook food. not everyone in Hollywood is some demonic warlord and not everyone has an elaborate agenda. https://t.co/K4H3gsSlS1 @JemmaThinks @JackPosobiec that is quite literally all you say. all day. I see it. all day. @CEOSalesforce good one, dork I really love you guys. I am okay I swear!! There is so much good here, in you, and it is why I stay!! You are quite literally my world. Your friend Chrissy has just HAD IT UP TO HEREEEEEE today @Dawstin1 @sgarber15 Every. Day. And when i do inevitably die, they\u2019ll believe they got me. @VictoriaDahl er wanting* lksglksdjglsd @VictoriaDahl like the past 6 months or so I've been feeling so buttoned up, not wanted to talk about anything because it just makes it worse. I feel like myself again! @VictoriaDahl nah it's ok please don't be - I think I'm just venting and bringing it to light. like life is good but this is really bad, you know? I'm happy and lucky in literally every other way I can tell when people know I'm losing my mind on twitter and they casually text me funny or nice things without addressing that I'm going absolutely apeshit. I see u and I love u twitter has honestly done an awesome job with filtering and blocking or if necessary, suspending accounts. instagram is not so good. but I'm not really content anymore with just...not seeing it. I wanna see it and I want to fight this shit. imagine this, all day every day, on every platform. defending yourself, and that defense just meaning you're getting worried. this is the exact type of person I am flooded with all day, every. fucking. day. https://t.co/oJBNMZGuPS honestly you guys are so normal and rational that I know it's hard to really understand it. it's easy to say \"just block and report\" - I literally have to have pics of some of these people in my garage because they live nearby I saw all this KNOWING they will never be like \"oh man, that Chrissy, she's a little too defensive. maybe she ISN'T a pedophile\" - I know it'll get worse. I don't care anymore. I'm not tiptoeing around your delusions anymore. @fordey70 @AlexandraErin I\u2019m honestly not positive if Q Is my boss or i am Q or they are Q I literally literally don\u2019t know what this means you absolute fucking nutcase pigfuck. What have you cracked here, sherlock https://t.co/xDsPrkzyP0 @AlexandraErin and then one day I\u2019ll die, they\u2019ll say it was Q and that\u2019s my life. @CNNRGLDN Thank u so much Connor! means a lot My Snapchat emoji was a pizza. I was MOCKING THEMMMMM AHHHHHHHH!!!! https://t.co/F6y7ITI0Wx I am so over these pieces of shit and not saying anything because they spiral. Go spiral you fucking losers. You\u2019re BATSHIT.

A tweet mocking a disgusting comment about a story ON SOMEONE ELSE. fucking Sherlock The best is when these sick losers are like \u201cLOOK!! She\u2019s rubbing it in all our faces!!! Q is COMING!!\u201d *Q never comes* THERE SHE GOES AGAIN!!!!! With the SYMBOLS!!! Someone do a movie on these pathetic NUTCASES I beg you It blows my mind that ppl think our flight was turned around so we could be arrested (no) then when we got to HK and my card declined, I would publicly admit to looking for work because my pedo dreams were shattered. Why would I be so out about my schemes? Fucking losers good god https://t.co/7Hy2nJO2T5 @mostlyhuman @IsntSheLovellly I should. Maybe cinco @MikeSchutte also this today\u2019s mood: https://t.co/9LdzKz5tQB @TeamJohnChrissy Love you so \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f @AITA_reddit I REALLY AM I\u2019ve had it @Gooeybutter1234 that WOULD be crazy! can you imagine? @PopBangHugh @Gooeybutter1234 @chezspence no I'm so curious about these people now. I would like to talk. I would love to hear it! @Gooeybutter1234 @chezspence ok! where are you thinking? @LBrovarnik hi I know we can't talk about yesterday but I love you! @chezspence but WHY not? shishito guy?? only excuse that I'm accepting I am writing this stuff mostly for me to remember. maybe I should get a notebook @MomsThoughts I meant love for the second appreciate. I have no brains today!! &lt;3 @MomsThoughts I really appreciate that, girl! thank you. I appreciate you always!!! what if I roasted halves of butternut squash with honey and herbs and made a crumble out of honey bunches of oats and you just ate it with a spoon @IsntSheLovellly It\u2019s uno leche tho @matt_magistro God I hope I was pregnant @CourtneySF @nottayIor MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm @r0ck3rgirl81 inclined. I dunno my word choice here very off today @r0ck3rgirl81 you can technically eat it with your hands, like u can with anything else in the world if you're so compelled I want to make a cookie that you soak in sweet cream right after baking, is iced and topped with salty sweet nuts and have to eat with a fork. question: is what I'm making a cake He didn\u2019t even flinch. The chimes sound like glass shattering. Boys are wild, man. the end, I\u2019m crying https://t.co/UYA7SeKf4A @nottayIor Maybe since I\u2019m using them with really rich and heavier things (stews, ramens) I don\u2019t notice it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever toss them with cheese and lemon or something. But now I wanna try.... I think they have fettuccini, spaghetti, a...rice shaped one. Anyhow I get them online or at Whole Foods and they may or may not change your life. I use this angel hair one under curries and in porky ramen broths. I truly love the chewy texture of it (I know that isn\u2019t normally a compliment) - the only weird part is rinsing them before using! But they\u2019re ready to heat and go after ok time to tell you about another current obsession I am NOT getting paid for....SHIRATAKE MUSHROOM NOODLES. let me be clear there is no 100% perfect carby noodle replacement (and there shouldn\u2019t be!!) but THESE ARE GREAT AND DELICIOUS IN THEIR OWN WAY https://t.co/Die4iGJb04 @bradygoodman @Jeremy_Danner NO!!!!!!! @Jeremy_Danner @bradygoodman I hate myself today!!!! I am go aggro!!!! @MaddySettle oh dear god I cannot say anything lsjdgosdjgopadjgaegj @Jeremy_Danner EXHIBIT A OF WHAT, JEREMY??? IM VERY ON EDGE RIGHT NOW B CAREFUL! someone do a movie about these accounts. I need to see these people. cannot imagine sitting on the computer, jerking it to maga models, just waiting for someone, anyone to say anything, anything u can shit on. \"oh shit she tweeted about tea HOW DO I MAKE THIS ABOUT TRUMP and what a fucking absolute tool I am\" https://t.co/OEj7dvCF3J @diesel_fish Get help, pigshit. Anyhoo again, this is not an ad. I just can\u2019t shut up about it. If you come to my house, you are hearing about this tea. There are so many flavors and it\u2019s gotten me to drink less horrible shit! Last night I had the strawberry shortcake tea and aaaaah, so maach like. And there\u2019s a thai iced tea sprinkle tea thing by the same brand. And and and the lemon ginger. Already sweet and ready to go I can\u2019t stop telling everyone i interact with about this tea. I think maybe my mind is blown because I\u2019ve always been staunchly against tea most my life. I have no stake in this and do not know the people behind it but DAMN, I love it https://t.co/PZJlECHPwC I've spent over 13 years of my life trying to bread fried chicken in varying proportions of parmesan and pork rinds, herbs and spices. when I get it to stick, this will be my legacy @sarahferg1e ooo thank you! @Victorm07997395 what is wrong with you? do you think you're being funny? is this how you wanna be online? genuinely curious why you would want to be like this. I'm in an understanding mood. I was going for less carbs, my ultimate goal always. my family holds 1 carb like everyone else holds 60 I wanted to deep fry wings with it but hooooo wee nevermind! you guys hate it! I love my little automatic focus group. @MandiMills12 @TheEllenShow @andylassner @MsSarahPaulson @ArianaGrande @ericstonestreet @iamjeanniek fake blood! @RambleOKRose lol @TheEllenShow @andylassner @MsSarahPaulson @ArianaGrande @ericstonestreet @iamjeanniek I don't know why, but I'm extremely protective of this experience and am really jealous of whoever gets to do it next, despite not even being the first. you guys use coconut flour? is there anything you notice a difference in or do not notice a difference in when comparing it to regular flour? some things it really works well for or some things it sucks with? RT @TheEllenShow: You all love it. It\u2019s almost time. @AndyLassner\u2019s annual trip through a haunted house.

I can't decide if I care anyhow when I am sad or bored I like to log onto instagram live so the alert freaks out my publicist so I'm just gonna do that all day. miley got them all on edge anyhow that is my morning rant. fuck you, fucking miserable Q shitfucks, you absolute fucking losers I have a love justice yes I have a love justice. when people do wrong, I need them to know they're wrong. this isn't a good or bad thing, but it's me/. the fact I have to learn to let people get away with shit like this is insane to me. it makes me ill inside. yep, they're just crazy! don't worry bout em! it's not just weirdos in random towns. these people are all over. I hate what some people have become and what social has done for this kind of reach. it sucks. and now they'll post this too, and it'll get even worse. I'm just so fucking tired. I had a real life before this. I mean...going to the grocery store and shit, parks alone with my kids. now I have a list of people in my area who genuinely believe we are in a pedo ring that is always *ALMOST* about to be exposed if I take legal action, it gets worse because then, to them, it's true and I'm trying to \"silence\" them. It's on posts about anything. Random 90 days fan pages, meme accounts, anything. Even if the content is normal, the comments are....this shit. u know what is not great? I still have to read on social media many times a day that John and I are pedophiles and look at photoshopped/miscaptioned photos of us on \"Epstein Island\" and I just have to deal with it because \"people are crazy these days\" Please keep this setup, im coming over This entire thing would be a shitshow for me but really picturing the damage I\u2019d do hopping to that red ball specifically https://t.co/gvNN2ih4BK @stuholden brackets are bullying and I will be writing your employer @broadwaylove 25 bebe not maach Changing this prompt to \u201cmyself\u201d has to be top 10 saddest moments for me https://t.co/3As1mAMTFs wait how so big!!?!? how when why https://t.co/YoMCuRJ1Xe @caitiedelaney LOL like get me out of here !!!!!!! lol lol @TheAuntifa Ah! https://t.co/xu3wpu7bcM @TheAuntifa Sink and buckets.

I\u2019m a little sick and everyone asking me if I want soup. I do. I\u2019m getting recommendations of Nate and Al\u2019s and Greenblatt\u2019s for chicken noodle but i prefer more veggies. Is there another chicken soup place in LA I need to know about? I know those two are GREAT yes! @deltafoxtrotII holly and michael both had the same maturity level, always!! I think they go to sandals a lot @AkilahObviously \u201cwhat are you\u201d @JADubin5 I don\u2019t think they ever get married, thus no divorce! Actually you know what? Phyllis and Bob are def still together. Dwight and Angela still together. Michael and Holly definitely together. Mathematically (i got a C+) SOMEONE here has to be divorced. It\u2019s Jim and Pam. @Nedsfeed wait what !!!! They never went to Austin. You know it and I know it. I talk about moving to Austin every other day and here I am. Not in Austin @oxwof I don\u2019t think they did I think that was another great idea that never happened!! Pam is unhappy but content with their income and children so she\u2019s like whatever and draws things for Etsy like cozy home signs (wait is this me) I think they\u2019re together but Philly Jim likes a taste of the high life and bottle service with athletes and Pam still can\u2019t figure out her phone so he never has to answer FaceTimes and he never gets caught guys I\u2019m loving your endless love optimism here but I didn\u2019t ask what you HOPE for, I asked what you actually think!! It has been 10 years since Jim and Pam got married. Do you think they are still together, separated, divorced or open marriage Sitting on this stoop was one of the greatest moments of my life. The entire day was glee and magic. Thank you to our heroes at @sesamestreet! https://t.co/JFG0ZTvj2E @NickStopTalking @tribranchvo I hate u lol he painted his own nipples @Im_SoFetch Outdoor acrylic.

But I'm still insanely confused when and how these air. they need to put in the order you watch every *different* 90 days show since there are like 6 seasons of each show and some have same couples, some different. @yashar thank u!!! I'm all over the place over here in what order did TLC air all these different 90 days? I'm really having difficulty navigating people's relationships. The before, the happily ever after, the regular one. do they air these in the same season? the back and forth killing me. and some just...end. sad!! \"Maybe we will be together in a different life.

They really do hear everything. #waittiltheend https://t.co/TUeKwY59KK @andrew_g_utes @Jack_Sapper then hoard some sandwich on a plate in front of you. be prepared. u know better! fool me once! I guess my point is, as precious as they are, please don't waste time being mad about sandwiches he says in the update it was not a huge subway sub, more of a local place where the sub isn't GARGANTUAN PARTY TIME SUB. I mean I am not disputing that is a LOT of sub but it's not 12 footlong subs. perhaps 6. lol https://t.co/rDAh4rK7Ne ****if I am drunk enough @andrew_g_utes yeah but if you're still mad about it the next day (after you got to eat snacks and wings and didn't NOT get any food) then that anger prob isn't good for you, my dude perhaps a good ol \"everyone sucks here\" but I think the sub eater sucks less than the people who really still care about this sandwich the next day. everyone is destroying this guy but I can eat 2 footlongs myself. usually a meatball and a cold cut trio. &amp; meatball is kind of heavy enough to be equal to 2 cold cuts like the sandwich portrayed here.

I do. @numinosity @eh122_dc @yashar It\u2019s like...the quickest scroll past ever guys @eh122_dc @numinosity @yashar It\u2019s a different time now. Sponsored posts from people in my feed is now an expected, given annoyance. If someone\u2019s good doesn\u2019t outweigh the annoying bad, then adios. @therealJMHL @yashar I say no to Instagram shilling ... a few times a day, every day. It needs to be a small part of a larger campaign to be considered. Then I gotta love it. @numinosity @yashar But like...celebs do hair care commercials or something on your television, or sell a makeup line, they want you to post about it. Unless you are talking about strictly Instagram stuff like tummy tea and corsets (I don\u2019t do those) @sgtwheels @yashar It\u2019s never just Instagram work. You sign up to endorse a brand and do a commercial for them and part of the deal now is always a few social posts. I do it if I love the company and also, the money? @yashar Going back and forth on email over a sentence change with a brand strategy team who then has to go back and forth with a giant company like unilever/PG is a lot sometimes. But yeah. Just a lot of cooks in the kitchen, more than people imagine. @yashar I\u2019ll never get it either. And brands do not like bending on their \u201csuggested copy\u201d so it\u2019s just easier to do what they say, even though it could be better 100 percent of the time.

I wish you could hear what else he said. @LeilaniMunter @johnlegend @OP_Society You should have seen the other things he said. He only posted what made him look good. It was one of the most terrible run ins of my life. Now I\u2019m scared to interact with people. I don\u2019t want to be scared. I appreciate the apology.
