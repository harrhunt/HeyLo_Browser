And Girl Scouts donating money to shelters? I\u2019ll clarify my \u201cnews\u201d\nComment before it becomes a blshit story. The current climate is that everything is bad. And a lot of it is. But there are so many beautiful people in this country who don\u2019t subscribe to any of this horseshit. We all get along. We believe in decency. Also(very important)my favorite part of the shows/crowds so far in America have been exactly what the news and social media don\u2019t want you to believe; this/our world is diverse and beautiful. And you have all shown up, co-existing peacefully and even lovingly. We r better 2gether \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/wQGWnU0q7K And that\u2019s a wrap on our first round of US dates!
