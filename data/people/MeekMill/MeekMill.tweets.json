Philadelphia Murder rate has been in the 300 murders plus range  since I can remember and kids are growing up in that first hand and they have no choice but to carry firearms after seeing all that blood spilled and That will distort you decision making process like PTSD The whole environment is drug related so I guess everything is drug related tho!  I grew up in the 90\u2019s where the crack laws had 60% of the grown men in prison for long terms and it left us with no guidance to follow up in their foot steps! Basically grew up in the wild Most of these murders aren\u2019t drug related and about protecting a street corner it\u2019s about people who are mentally destroyed from drugs or trauma! I know many people doing life in prison for trying to protect themselves and it was labeled as drug related!
