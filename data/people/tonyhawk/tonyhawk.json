Not sure what it has to do with texting but I make no money from either one. Just thought it was funny. @gupimusic It\u2019s still upsetting, and now we have \u201cHODL\u201d to carry the torch Follow up: I asked him his name and he said Irving. I told him my name is Tony, to which he replied sarcastically \u201clike Tony Hawk haha\u201d\nand then he left. Kid at skatepark (as I arrive): \u201cyou a good skater?\nme: sometimes\nhim: you ever been here?\nme: no\nhim: you travel a lot?\nme: yes, perhaps too much \nhim: are you a YouTuber?\nme: no, I\u2019m just a skater and a dad\nhim: wanna see me do a jump?\nme: absolutely\n..and I then shot this pic https://t.co/IBODPauEe2 Looking forward to it! I\u2019ve been riding the Bitcoin transitions for over 5 years now. Which reminds me... should I bring my ramp? https://t.co/0rDyit2Th1 @nnoahfitzgerald It\u2019s me! I was thinking about this flip-board-transfer thing for years and finally tried it last week, even creating a comically shaped landing board. The hardest part was aiming, and then leaning forward at the end. It was a brutal battle but I\u2019ve already recovered thanks to @CannaHempX https://t.co/q1AmEnUjQN That time I was a \u201cMystery Diver\u201d on ABC\u2019s Splash. I\u2019m just thankful that \u201cDo A Kickflip\u201d wasn\u2019t a thing back then... it would have been the worst credit card ever. https://t.co/vPsQ17NWnb @halo57634 @The_Hermit_Crab @John97Jackson I too cringe when I see it. I let spellcheck undermine my grammar on that one because I was rushed trying to get the Tweet out before takeoff. Me talk good otherwise... Whose reading these anyway? \n(SWIDT) Translation: my son @rileyhawk666 was sponsored by the company she works for years ago, but he is no longer with them (they let him go because he rarely competes on TV... their loss). And apparently they never update their website. \nIn other words, she has no Hawks to speak of. Woman at restaurant: \u201cTony?\u201d\nme: yes\n\u201cI came over to say hi because we have you\u201d\nhuh?\n\u201cat _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (company name)\u201d\nI don\u2019t understand\n\u201cyou\u2019re on our team!\u201d\nthat\u2019s not me\n\u201cbut you\u2019re on our website\u201d\nyou mean my son Riley\n\u201cyeah that\u2019s it\u201d\nbut you let him go years ago\n\u201cwe did?\u201d @katiemaller It was me! This is a powerful message about bullying. When I was young I got \"picked on\" because I was skinny, nerdy and rode a skateboard (which was NOT cool then). Recognizing this as being bullied has been cathartic, but I am thankful that there are now effective ways to end the cycle. https://t.co/ZkE55RPhv3 @LameAsChris All is forgiven. Sick nosegrind shuv btw. Let me know what you think of my weird flip transfer thing if you saw it. @LameAsChris This is absolutely fake. I would never discourage someone from skating, nor do I care how someone holds their skateboard. Sorry I didn\u2019t reply to you (in reality) but at least you got attention out of it. @_spice_boy Wiener dog Answering the important questions...\n+1 (760) 492-6712 https://t.co/HkwlNAuI73 Correction: the Jubilee is October 26 I'm honored to speak at @alzassociation Chocolate Jubilee in Detroit 10/25.
