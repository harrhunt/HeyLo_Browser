My energy levels have been the hardest to take control of. @MctavAnnie Out of curiosity ... when did you start synthroid ? I got diagnosed very young, 15 .... so they said synthroid is made for / safe to take starting middle-aged.. that\u2019s why I personally had to find an alternative! But it\u2019s so helpful for everyone to add their personal stories here I spent a few months every year in Mexico growing up (my parents had work there for a period of time)... and it\u2019s always amazing and comforting to get back to and experience the gentle open energy, big hearts, and beautiful positive spirits of Mexican people and culture !!!!! \ud83d\udc9b https://t.co/EJNJapHxN7 I\u2019d love to go to culinary school to get better at the technical aspect of cooking !!!

There are holistic ways that won\u2019t have long term negative effects on your body !!! Talk to alternative doctors &amp; find out what your options are :) that\u2019s my advice just based on personal experience! If your thyroid hasn\u2019t been removed, and is just under active, find out what state your immune system is in. Once you deal with the underlying causes within your body (which most dr\u2019s don\u2019t check for unfortunately) it\u2019s possible to regain a more normal thyroid function \u2014 https://t.co/rfZNqeDEDo SO MUCH.

(Pinned tweet on my profile for inspired gifts by UNICEF for kids in need worldwide) But a lot of people have been ripped off for a while now..&amp; at the end of the day this oftentimes leads to wasted food. So it\u2019s an issue. https://t.co/CsGbBUQ6Ac @AaronSlam13 ya everything on Postmates is impersonal and automated. They don\u2019t care... that\u2019s the problem haha lol same https://t.co/3vI91OFNCI No I don\u2019t want to DM and it\u2019s not just a personal issue that has been going on countless times for a long time. I don\u2019t want special treatment, I want every one of your customers to be treated better when they use your app. https://t.co/EsS5bzQQBq (cont) you have heard from enough people whose time and money you\u2019ve wasted to act like you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on- it takes away from the hardworking Postmates you do have. Just do better. (cont) The amount of times food is damaged, taken, or doesn\u2019t arrive correctly is only less disgraceful than how your CS Representatives act from an unreachable pedestal. Your one-sandwich refund is just annoying after 5-10 business days and (cont)\n@Postmates . @Postmates you have the worst customer service of all time. Have been a great customer for years, and hoped as a company you\u2019d realize the real need to better the quality of your services as a whole. \ud83d\ude4f Coming soon \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/X91oim5pER LOVE\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/4wpdUQ4MOn SUPERCALIFRAGOLISTICEXPEALIDOCIOUS https://t.co/bagMyQq3Sc I didn\u2019t wanna take my Mary costume off :( https://t.co/d5s1uZEvZ8 \ud83d\ude2d.

Use your energy to lift those that you admire rather than be cruel to those u don\u2019t. I will not further explain the way my body looks, just as anyone, with a  body type that doesnt suit ur \u201cbeauty\u201d expectation, shouldnt have to. Not to judge others, but drugs are not my thing, stop putting me in that box just because u dont understand the way my body has matured. (cont) am still learning and growing with my body everyday, as everyone is. Although stress &amp; excessive travel can also affect the body, I have always eaten the same, my body just handles it differently now that my health is better. I may be \u201ctoo skinny\u201d for u, honestly this skinny isn\u2019t what I want to be, but I feel healthier internally and (cont) Over the last few years I\u2019ve been properly medicated to help symptoms including those, as well as extreme fatigue, metabolism issues, body\u2019s ability to retain heat, etc ... I was also part of a holistic medical trial that helped my thyroid levels balance out. For those of you so determined to come up w why my body has changed over the years, you may not know that when I started @ 17 I was not yet diagnosed w/Hashimoto\u2019s disease; those of u who called me \u201ctoo big for the industry\u201d were seeing inflammation &amp; water retention due to that.

Also, hi Berlin. I really like your snapchat filters. Cully told me to watch season 1 of prison break sooo be back never @robstaintonboss I didnt. But we know he went to her car when she gave him the magazine. His sweat on the hood doesn't seem suspicious to me RT @RngrRhyno: @GiGiHadid slanted. There are tons of holes, he doesn't seem competent enough to totally wipe the garage, bedroom...of dna RT @RngrRhyno: @GiGiHadid I believe there is definite reasonable doubt, and have no idea how 7 NG could be swayed by 3 G. I just think the \u2026 @DrZielie if u were 2 move bones to hide something, u wouldnt move 2 pieces. Pieces miles away were accidentally left @ the actual burn site @RngrRhyno I'm saying no evidence undoubtably proves it was Steven Avery &amp; to me, points more towards him being framed. By who, I dont know. Even if u dont think it's a conspiracy within the police force, the states theory &amp; the evidence found dont match up https://t.co/ekWS2nwQwG They went INto jury discussion on the side of not guilty. Something happened in that room &amp; they changed their mind\ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/EmjNnZojmO Definitely strange and seemed more concerned about convicting SA than knowing the truth..?  https://t.co/gLZUb8Vali @doublegiforce happy birthday love !!! Hope you are having the best day \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc8b I just feel so much is missing from the #MaM case. Even if SA is guilty, they should have had at least some unquestionable evidence. I hope parents of kids with similar cognitive disabilities to Brendan's see #MaM &amp; learn from/prepare that child to stand up for themselves I almost hope I'm wrong &amp; they are guilty, because knowing they're probably going to sit in jail for the rest of their lives makes me sick. &amp; that makes me so sad bc corruption in that law enforcement community is obvious to me. They will clearly do anything to silence someone. someone who actually knows what happened comes forward and does the right thing. Unless the technology has progressed enough to test the blood again, I think the only way Steven will be granted retrial is if &gt; There should be laws that protect people like Brendan Dassey. It breaks my heart that he hasn't yet been granted retrial. What's hardest for me is seeing a 16 year old kid, now in his mid 20's who clearly doesn't have the tools to deal with this situation. \u2014 I don't understand how the jury had no doubt beyond reason that all this evidence added up and/or didn't contradict each other. \u2014 Heads up: I want to voice my opinion about Making a Murderer, so if you haven't finished it yet, don't read the tweets to follow this one.. Will have another update of emotion for you in 2 hrs when I've finished it... brb #MaM w. t. f. Haven't finished yet but #MaM is blowing my mind. I'm so heartbroken and confused ?!!!!?!?!
