Launching TOMORROW on Friday, 09\u2026 I am a strong believer that in order for change to happen, you must be willing to work with all people, even when you have differences in political opinions. @ANCA_DC I will be visiting Armenia in the next 2 weeks and hope to seek ways I can help increase trade and hopefully create jobs for Armenians which includes @skims production there in the future. @ANCA_DC As a brand, we believe in embracing all people and as an individual I have been working towards broader goals in hopes of bringing forward the recognition of the Armenian genocide which I remain very passionate about. @ANCA_DC We consulted with experts and searched globally for the best in class options, some which was found in Turkey. We believe strongly against discrimination of any kind; against anyone or any nation based on the past. @ANCA_DC Thank you @anca_dc for your concerns &amp; support. When I first began dreaming of owning my own shapewear company, I knew I wanted every piece to be made the best way possible; from the finest materials; starting from design stage through to creation, testing, innovation &amp; fit. https://t.co/Xzbzncnolh Listen to the @foodgod\u2019s podcast yet?!

I don\u2019t have any relationships with these sites. I\u2019m not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don\u2019t support what these companies are doing. I often plan for weeks, sometimes months, and even a year in advance, and I\u2019m grateful for every fashion moment those designers and their dresses have helped me create. My relationships with designers are very important to me. It's taken me over a decade to build them and I have a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that they put into bringing their ideas to life. This is a way to get people to sign up for their mailing list and make people believe there is some kind of relationship between me and this fashion site. There is not. Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn\u2019t even been made to sell yet. I\u2019ve watched these companies profit off my husband\u2019s work for years and now that it\u2019s also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent. It\u2019s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas. We lost a true legend! You were such an inspiration to the world! You shot my first fashion shoot &amp; I was so nervous to work w such an icon! The world is so much chicer because u existed! I\u2019m beyond honored to have had the opportunity to work w u. U are so loved &amp; will be missed https://t.co/0BSXoLDNN7 My whole heart \u2665\ufe0f https://t.co/70LKCvGltF Morning \u2728 @kkwbeauty https://t.co/BU2hlPOVos \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/vbKhF6juhB #Mugler https://t.co/vj65wr20d7 @rodashian Happy Birthday beautiful!!!
