Some stories have suggested we were shipping over private messages to partners, so we wanted to clarify a few things. They were clear to users and only available when people logged into these services with FB. We had strict rules in place over how partners could use APIs and what data they could and couldn't access. The partnerships were experimental and ended years ago. But we publicized the features then because we wanted people to use them: https://t.co/DtZOGljU4z. \u201cDelete access\u201d meant that if you deleted a message from within Spotify, it would also delete from FB. At the time, in order for you to write a message to a FB friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify \u201cwrite access.\u201d For you to be able to read messages back, we needed Spotify to have \u201cread access.\u201d These experiences are common in our industry \u2014 think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud. Here\u2019s an example of how it worked if you used Facebook on Spotify: https://t.co/2Zryf4Ck0R We worked closely with 4 partners (Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, Royal Bank of Canada) to integrate messaging into their products so people could message their FB friends \u2014 but only if they chose to use FB Login In the past day, we've been accused of disclosing people's private messages to partners without their knowledge.
