Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren\u2019t covered by tuition-free public college! 1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes &amp; everyone enjoys. We don\u2019t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods.\n\n2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone\u2019s invested! This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, &amp; it\u2019s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this.\n\nJust like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition-free public college. \n\nHere\u2019s why. https://t.co/pWprP0qrhG Hoping everyone is enjoying a warm &amp; happy Thanksgiving.\n\nI am thankful for so much this year: my friends, family, and loved ones; the blessing of good health, &amp; the opportunity to serve our community and country.\n\nGratitude is a practice! What are you grateful for this year? \u2b07\ufe0f Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves \u201cfiscally responsible,\u201d yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression.\n\nEverything has a price. And an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in &amp; values all people. None of the politicians who brand themselves \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight.\n\nNone of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration.\n\nAsk yourself why that is. This is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about \u201cpay-fors\u201d in healthcare, housing, etc so often are made in bad faith.\n\nI see decisions made every day that cost the American public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it. /2 Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP.\n\nI saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill. Nobody cared then how we\u2019d pay for it.\n\nNow ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students.\n\nYet we were called radical for opposing it. Abolish ICE. https://t.co/9uMtKmyEI1 RT @nowthisnews: \u2018We have to reclaim our public systems.\u2019 \u2014\u00a0Rep. @AOC explained how her Green New Deal for Public Housing Act will fix publ\u2026 RT @FlyingWithSara: \"People's lives are not commodities.\" This is what we must drive home.

And yes, those forces exist among all parties. Our political system\u2019s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts, but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers\u2019 time away from lawmaking.\n\nThat\u2019s a feature, not a flaw - the less time lawmakers have, the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions. Instead, your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues &amp; exposing abuse of power.\n\nSo while Fox continues to laugh that I\u2019m \u201cjust a bartender,\u201d I\u2019ve spend the whole year studying big pharma, private equity, military contractors, and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s shady deals. There is, of course, much more time for me to be fully present at my job. \n\nIn Congress, this is a luxury. Since I don\u2019t spend hours each day asking for money, I spend a lot more time legislating, studying, &amp; preparing/sitting in hearings.\n\nThis has cumulative effects over time. I intentionally built my campaign to rely on small-dollar grassroots support w/o any corporate $, because I felt that\u2019s the best way to be accountable to everyday people.\n\nIt has impacted how I work in Congress in powerful ways - ways I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until I got here. While many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people &amp; the public good, in truth it\u2019s more powerful than ever.\n\nI haven\u2019t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars, &amp; I don\u2019t meet w/ corp lobbyists. \n\nThat is the power of your grassroots support. https://t.co/BDxvMETBnS RT @UNEP: \ud83d\udd34 We're on perilous ground \ud83d\udd34\n\nWe are on track for a temperature rise of over 3\u00b0C.

Recognizing white supremacy in ourselves - our institutions, our subconscious, our own past remarks or acts (no matter how consciously unintentional), is what makes the healing work ahead challenging. \n\nBut it is not impossible,and confronting it is the only way to move forward. Perhaps more than the obvious last steps of the supremacist,we must examine the nuance of their first steps.\n\nThat is a painful inquiry, bc for many, we may see familiarity in those first steps. And that familiarity is very difficult to see + admit. We\u2019d rather not talk about it. Healing ourselves of white supremacy will be hard. It will be hard because it requires us to confront *ourselves.*\n\nWe wish it was as simple as denouncing a white hood, a burnt cross, vile language.

Foreign policy: Reinstate US humanitarian aid in the Northern Triangle, where people are fleeing. US should start acting like a real partner in Latin America,&amp; increase visas where we intervene. The cruelty is the goal. It\u2019s called \u201cdeterrence\u201d - a policy stance that if our country inflicts enough pain on refugees, they will think twice before believing America is worth their dreams &amp; aspirations.\n\nOnly policy change can end cruelty, not blank checks to the status quo. https://t.co/QSSCIo2rLJ The GOP\u2019s grand plan to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is to hurt children, immigrants, refugees into thinking America isn\u2019t great - that it\u2019s cruel &amp; inhumane - so people don\u2019t come at all.\n\nBut America isn\u2019t America at all without immigrants.\n\nTo turn them away is Un-American. https://t.co/bpYFCqOxXe When you stand up to bullies once, it gets easier to do each following time.\n\nI am used to the right\u2019s behavior towards me - but I will never get used to their heartless cruelty towards other human beings escaping violence &amp; despair, nor their indifference to everyday Americans. https://t.co/TyiNZYqHG3 @hayleyalvz Of course.

Dred Scott was the landmark Supreme Court case that found the US Constitution didn\u2019t give citizenship to black people.\n\nThe 1st US immigration law was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a race-based policy that was upheld until 1942.\n\nThe \u201cNational Origins Formula\u201d lasted til \u201865. The history of Citizenship in the US is deeply woven with the history of racism.

The reason your abuela was \u201clegal\u201d was likely bc there was effectively no \u201cillegal\u201d US immigration when she came, except for the Chinese.\n\nThe US\u2019 first imm law was the Chinese Exclusion Act, &amp; explicit racism was allowed as legal grounds for US immigration laws until *1952.* https://t.co/rP316bIrd5 RT @GretaThunberg: Hope is contagious!\nI met with the inspiring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, @AOC .\nHere is our discussion!\n#FridaysForFuture\u2026 \u201c\u2066I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d And I say: \u201cAct.\u201d\n\nIt was such an honor to share this conversation with you, \u2066@GretaThunberg\u2069.\n\nThank you for being one of the leading voices on climate action today. https://t.co/ke1pzaO8pf Reminder that these camps are run **at a profit** and financed by private equity groups, many of whom lobby politicians to imprison more people.\n\nWall Street has made human rights abuse an incentivized, for-profit venture. https://t.co/9zABsm7WQ5 Pretty awful that the right would make a joke of visiting a child CBP camp - but fitting, given that they don\u2019t seem to care one shred about other people\u2019s lives.\n\nPS That watch belonged to my dad.

When I was looking at lobbying from the outside, just as a normal voting citizen, it appeared to me as more transactional in nature than it actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily that a lobbyist calls you and says \u201cvote/don\u2019t vote for this bill or we won\u2019t donate to you again...\u201d /2 This is how corporate lobbying works:\n\nLobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ \u201csensible\u201d talking points to mask intent + say policy is \u201cmisguided,\u201d then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points. https://t.co/EB9TDkANYj It\u2019s true.\n\nThe #GreenNewDeal, as much as GOP hiss, scream, storytell &amp; cry about it, has forced even the most entrenched Tea Partiers into publicly abandoning their climate denial stance.\n\nThe reason they\u2019re so focused on discrediting the GND is because it\u2019s a winning policy. \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/hzjchYZV6N This is why a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach to our climate crisis is unacceptable.\n\nThis isn\u2019t like other issues where you can pretend you\u2019re a sober adult by cutting the difference between left and right.\n\nYou\u2019re either fighting for our future or you\u2019re not.\n\nhttps://t.co/YLOVzNe2Z9 Happy #MothersDay!\n\nLet\u2019s celebrate by making 3 months paid parental leave the minimum standard for all workers in the United States. \ud83c\udf39\n\nhttps://t.co/oVqLee1ffd RT @tianran: The @Guardian editorial board comes out for a Green New Deal, saying we need it now  https://t.co/xCnMTw0iM0 &gt;&gt; @AOC @Stephani\u2026 If you think your \u2018celibacy\u2019 is due to \u201cfemale empowerment,\u201d maybe it\u2019s because far too many people relied on the disempowerment + silence of women to not be \u2018celibate\u2019 in the first place. https://t.co/GWHuxrfOGF Direct \ud83c\udf4e action \ud83e\udd66 gets \ud83c\udf47 the goods! \ud83c\udf52\ud83d\uded2\n\nCongratulations to Stop &amp; Shop workers, who along w/ teachers + many other workers over the past year successfully protected their salary &amp; working conditions from cuts through collective action. https://t.co/jRTF2WYWaS A little over 1 year ago today. \u2b07\ufe0f #KnockDowntheHouse https://t.co/OIdgzEUvji"}
