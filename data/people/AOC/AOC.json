It will get worse the longer we do nothing #GreenNewDeal A thread of some of the policy approaches we should consider wrt immigration:\n\n1. Foreign policy: Reinstate US humanitarian aid in the Northern Triangle, where people are fleeing. US should start acting like a real partner in Latin America,&amp; increase visas where we intervene. The cruelty is the goal. It\u2019s called \u201cdeterrence\u201d - a policy stance that if our country inflicts enough pain on refugees, they will think twice before believing America is worth their dreams &amp; aspirations.\n\nOnly policy change can end cruelty, not blank checks to the status quo. https://t.co/QSSCIo2rLJ The GOP\u2019s grand plan to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is to hurt children, immigrants, refugees into thinking America isn\u2019t great - that it\u2019s cruel &amp; inhumane - so people don\u2019t come at all.\n\nBut America isn\u2019t America at all without immigrants.\n\nTo turn them away is Un-American. https://t.co/bpYFCqOxXe When you stand up to bullies once, it gets easier to do each following time.\n\nI am used to the right\u2019s behavior towards me - but I will never get used to their heartless cruelty towards other human beings escaping violence &amp; despair, nor their indifference to everyday Americans. https://t.co/TyiNZYqHG3 @hayleyalvz Of course.

When I was looking at lobbying from the outside, just as a normal voting citizen, it appeared to me as more transactional in nature than it actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily that a lobbyist calls you and says \u201cvote/don\u2019t vote for this bill or we won\u2019t donate to you again...\u201d /2 This is how corporate lobbying works:\n\nLobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ \u201csensible\u201d talking points to mask intent + say policy is \u201cmisguided,\u201d then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points. https://t.co/EB9TDkANYj It\u2019s true.\n\nThe #GreenNewDeal, as much as GOP hiss, scream, storytell &amp; cry about it, has forced even the most entrenched Tea Partiers into publicly abandoning their climate denial stance.\n\nThe reason they\u2019re so focused on discrediting the GND is because it\u2019s a winning policy. \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/hzjchYZV6N This is why a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach to our climate crisis is unacceptable.\n\nThis isn\u2019t like other issues where you can pretend you\u2019re a sober adult by cutting the difference between left and right.\n\nYou\u2019re either fighting for our future or you\u2019re not.\n\nhttps://t.co/YLOVzNe2Z9 Happy #MothersDay!\n\nLet\u2019s celebrate by making 3 months paid parental leave the minimum standard for all workers in the United States. \ud83c\udf39\n\nhttps://t.co/oVqLee1ffd RT @tianran: The @Guardian editorial board comes out for a Green New Deal, saying we need it now  https://t.co/xCnMTw0iM0 &gt;&gt; @AOC @Stephani\u2026 If you think your \u2018celibacy\u2019 is due to \u201cfemale empowerment,\u201d maybe it\u2019s because far too many people relied on the disempowerment + silence of women to not be \u2018celibate\u2019 in the first place. https://t.co/GWHuxrfOGF Direct \ud83c\udf4e action \ud83e\udd66 gets \ud83c\udf47 the goods! \ud83c\udf52\ud83d\uded2\n\nCongratulations to Stop &amp; Shop workers, who along w/ teachers + many other workers over the past year successfully protected their salary &amp; working conditions from cuts through collective action. https://t.co/jRTF2WYWaS A little over 1 year ago today. \u2b07\ufe0f #KnockDowntheHouse https://t.co/OIdgzEUvji This is a technique of the GOP, to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and \u201cfact check\u201d it.\n\nLike the \u201cworld ending in 12 years\u201d thing, you\u2019d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it\u2019s literal.\n\nBut the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows. https://t.co/pmkwrdeAnq And in the meantime, as we continue fighting for Medicare for All, a living wage, &amp; more:\n\nUnionize your workplace.\nDemand a raise.\nAnd don\u2019t stop until you get one. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd Ultimately, living in a moral society, a good nation, means establishing some basic standards of dignity:\n- healthcare as a right\n- a living wage\n- public education that prepares for civil society + economy (which now shld incl college)\n- all people having power in the economy When we say \u201ctax the rich,\u201d we mean nesting-doll yacht rich.

As a nation, we are more prosperous than we ever have been.\n\nBut that\u2019s simply not the lived truth. Even now, I\u2019m paid similar to a doctor or corporate lawyer - many who\u2018d think they are \u201crich,\u201d but it\u2019s nowhere near what we actually mean in policy.

Vote your values. The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners\u2019 plights for a tax break, yet refuse to pay for those same miners\u2019 healthcare for black lung. All of this is to say don\u2019t let any politician, no matter the party, lecture you about what is \u201cpossible\u201d or \u201celectable.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ever let a politician imply that working people are \u201cless-than\u201d or \u201cuneducated\u201d - aka that they are the ones in the way of solving the climate crisis. Then he said, \u201cI like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You\u2019re real and you get it.\u201d\n\nI thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart. I somehow got it out: \u201cWith all respect sir, how do you... manage to support both of us at the same time?\u201d\n\nThis is what he said:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for years that climate change is our most important crisis.

I never forget that, and moments like these drive it home.\n\nThank you to the people of NY14 + beyond. This House belongs to all of us. https://t.co/EPW5vP3lrP Lastly, if anyone has recommendations for baby gear that folds up nicely or tips on how to prep a workplace for little ones, please give me your recs!\n\nIf you\u2019re a new mom/parent + could bring your babies / kids to work, what would help that? What would you want to see? \u2b07\ufe0f 8. This is convo is bigger than parental leave - it\u2019s a larger conversation about how modern work has grown so hostile to family life. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way!\n\nWork + family can go together, but we have to break down the barriers that force people to choose between them. 7. Additionally, paying a living min wage to our most junior staffers means they\u2019re talented + capable (no 2nd job) to take over big-time situations, meaning senior staffers are confident enough in them to take parental leave and not feel like everything will fall apart. 6. We make an effort to make our office family-friendly. We talk about what play mats + cribs we need along w/ our legislative agenda. My personal office can be used for pumping/feeding.\n\nStaff can bring their babies to work if they like &amp; we are working to prepare to have them. 5. Equal pay at work is about SO much more than the salary you offer.\n\nIf you give dads less paid parental leave than moms, you\u2019re contributing to the pay gap.\n\nIf you see pregnancy or family as a workplace obstacle, you\u2019re contributing to the pay gap. 4. I want to reiterate how important it is to give dads full parental leave. I strongly encourage them to take the full time.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the \u201cnormal\u201d paternity leave is 2 weeks. That is NOT okay! As my partner says: \u201cWhat do employers expect those new moms to do? Walk it off?\u201d 3. Our 12 weeks parental leave is up to the parent on how they want to use that time. They don\u2019t have to take all 12 weeks at once - for example, they can take 5 weeks off and work 2 days a week to transition in; bank 3 weeks for later in the year, etc.   /4 2. Paid parental leave applies to ALL new parents, period. Moms, dads, parents; biological or adopted. If you\u2019ve got a new child, you get  12 weeks to spend adjusting your family to this huge transition.\n\n/3 A few notes on our approach:\n\n1. Expecting a child has nothing to do with our hiring decisions, &amp; we do everything we can to accommodate. That\u2019s supposed to be law, but there are small ways (incl self-selection) where it can play a role. We work to be a pro-family workplace.\n\n/2 I\u2019d like to share another \u201cunusual\u201d (but shouldn\u2019t be) part of my office policy w/ you all: Parental Leave!\n\nThree members of our small team are expectant or new parents in the first 6 mos of my term.\n\nIn my office, *every* new parent receives 3 mos paid leave - including dads. RT @drmistercody: \"The post office loses money!\"\n\n\"They started losing money after the GOP made them prefund pensions by 75 years.\"\n\n\"Peopl\u2026 We chose to go on the climate offense with the #GreenNewDeal.\n\nAs a result, climate denial is now a losing position + we got GOP (incl #WheresMitch!) to finally admit that climate change is real + man-made.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to go after predatory lending.\n\nWhose side is the GOP on? https://t.co/1nI4UQnEVB Really, the biggest, boldest idea (other than war) the GOP has proposed is A Wall.\n\nAt this rate they\u2019re gonna propose getting us to space w/ trebuchets.\n\nThey constantly hate, but have 0 real solutions for income inequality, healthcare, climate crisis, racial injustice, etc. GOP is talking smack about the Post Office (of course, since they have no ideas).\n\nThe funny thing about that: it\u2018s the GOP\u2019s own \u201cbusiness model\u201d that hurt them!

I may disagree w/ approach (keeping the ACA as-is w/small tweaks, etc), but at least that\u2019s a policy convo.\n\nBut to make decisions based on the political efficacy of a bigoted argument gives that bigotry power, &amp; that\u2019s a problem. We can\u2019t gloss over it, or quietly consider that the \u201cshrewd\u201d thing to do is nominate someone who won\u2019t be subject to bigoted attacks.\n\nMorally, we can\u2019t give a pass to this dangerous tactic.\n\nBut even politically, the Dem base is all the people you demoralize by not standing up. When \u201ccentrists\u201d care more about the GOP base than the Dem base, bigotry gets legitimized.\n\nThis is *the* playbook. GOP does it w/ virtually every Dem figure who isn\u2019t a white male: otherize, demonize + splinter.\n\nIt\u2019s vital that we adapt &amp; dismantle this approach, not cow to it. https://t.co/dKlzflqZVn RT @PostOpinions: An op-ed from @IlhanMN:\n \nI've seen firsthand the devastating toll of war.

White supremacists, like many extremists, get radicalized online.
