Go see #TheOrville at Comic-Con Saturday!!! Because, remember, we\u2019re not just seeing a trend here at home. We\u2019re seeing the same thing all around the world. Social media as a platform for unedited, unvetted information dispersal free from an obligation to truth has helped propel other Trumps to victory around the globe. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP I see BIG differences between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. The rise of social media and the spread of misinformation, in my view, has played a colossal role in the \u201cevolution\u201d of political discourse. I see big differences in the politics of the last 4 years vs. the last 40. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP I understand that feeling. When Obama\u2019s justice department failed to hold accountable the Bush-era officials who participated in torture, I remember vehemently opposing the \u201cmove on\u201d philosophy. It set a bad precedent, and precedent is important. It\u2019s all wearily complex. https://t.co/B2ADVQjo3G I agree. We do everything within our power to battle it. Right now, our power is limited. We don\u2019t have the White House, the Senate, or the Supreme Court. Not enough of us voted in every election when it counted. Fine, we learned that lesson. Now, we need a reliable strategy. https://t.co/8mlqtoaZcr Please read Brooking and Singer\u2019s wonderful book \u201cLikeWar.\u201d It\u2019s a terrific reality check that this platform needs. Social media helped propel Trump to victory in 2016. The solution to alcoholism isn\u2019t more alcohol. Unless it\u2019s just one, I guess. https://t.co/c7SywL9juq Trump has made 90 billion prior comments just like this. There\u2019s no surprise here. We know who he is. That\u2019s why 2020 is crucial. That won\u2019t happen if the party is divided like it was in 2016. If it\u2019s Harris, I\u2019ll vote. If it\u2019s Biden, I\u2019ll vote. Pete, Bernie, Warren, I\u2019ll vote. https://t.co/3PImSt7kuA I like your version better. Sadly, the public has never reacted that way to dense political material (and an impeachment proceeding would be packed with it). Moderate viewers would be invested for about a week, go back to The Bachelor, then blame Democrats for dragging it out. https://t.co/M86B5EVk48 Exactly. For the record, I think a Green New Deal is not only a good idea, but essential for survival of our species. But I also don\u2019t want to see it fizzle due to inexperienced legislative execution. There has to be unification. But the comment below? This is what Trump wants. https://t.co/YduKH4P9DZ We agree. That\u2019s been my point. Democrats are all on the same side. Everyone wants him out due to this kind of incident, and an infinity of others. The difference of opinion is over procedure. Work with each other to unify on a solution, but save the finger pointing for him. https://t.co/wV1thZK0Mw We have seen all this before. He\u2019s using the oldest trick in the book. He sees unrest among Democrats, so he\u2019s stirring the pot and throwing gas on the fire below. It\u2019s purely in the interest of igniting chaos. All too often, we fall for it. Let\u2019s see the bully for what he is. https://t.co/BVQJpj7MJk Did we mention #TheOrville is coming to Comic-Con? You\u2019ll see what we mean. Get ready! https://t.co/oObWZVmLoL Repeated studies show that, statistically, social media (where both Left and Right get most of their news) spreads more misinformation, conspiracies, and falsehoods than actual news. The editorial/fact-checking process of traditional newspapers/media has never been more precious. NEXT WEEKEND AT COMIC-CON... https://t.co/htFfy7ug41 Much obliged https://t.co/J352NxeODa Unlikely, as the voting public is clearly tired of Trump\u2019s erratic, extreme behavior. Even interest in his tweets has fallen off. But perceived \u201cdrastic\u201d behavior by the left (i.e. an impeachment) will drive them away as well. \u201cTrump can\u2019t win, but the Democrats can lose.\u201d https://t.co/yLmwRZnIAY RT @OutsideComicCon: We are THRILLED to reveal that @SethMacFarlane and the team from @TheOrville are bringing #TheOrvilleExperience to San\u2026 It really all depends on what your endgame is. I want us to focus squarely on winning in 2020. To put out the fire before redecorating the home. I understand that other progressives have other priorities. And I make that statement without sarcasm, truly. https://t.co/8DwjPQdo0k This GOP has shown us with crystal clarity who they are and where their loyalties lie. It would fail. They would then effectively accuse Democrats of wasting time and resources, and throngs of moderate voters would hand Trump a second term. Eyes on the ball: Vote him out. https://t.co/kb3H1w5xIw 1) An impeachment attempt begins. We all jump for joy. Trump is ecstatic. 2) Impeachment fails. 3) Trump shouts \u201cI have been exonerated!\u201d 4) A weary, substantial number of essential voters resent the Democratic Party for wasting time and energy. 5) Trump is re-elected in 2020. https://t.co/MUCUKsEztt Whether you like Pelosi or not, a 92% rating from the ACLU with regard to her voting record would seem to indicate that it\u2019s more textured than that. The larger issue is the \u201cif you\u2019re not with us, you\u2019re against us\u201d methodology that seeks to silence all strategic discussion. https://t.co/6gap4nmAtn I was the child of a teacher and a personal assistant, both of whom were true liberal progressives, and both of whom worked multiple jobs, as money was scarce.

My primary issue is the outsized, disproportionate role that social media -Twitter in particular - plays in politics. This extremely complex topic requires a multi-tiered process of reasoning, for which social media has no room. There\u2019s no way t https://t.co/1UmXnRE0gZ Someone should do an episode of TV about that.  Oh hey, go watch #TheOrville! https://t.co/GeIS5CSreN The issue can\u2019t be summed up in a tweet, but a good reference for the troubled relationship between politics and social media is P.W. Singer and Emerson Brooking\u2019s book, \u201cLikeWar,\u201d which discusses social media as it relates to political division. Entertaining read too.

Calm, cool reasoning.\u201d -Mike Brady https://t.co/E4rG1uSSWP Last I\u2019ll say bout the issue: I truly contend that the inclusion of a whooping studio audience at the debates is not only distracting, but in fact damaging and counterproductive to the political process. Town halls aside, it\u2019s time to pressure the powers-that-be over this. After two debates, @PeteButtigieg stands out to me as the most substantive candidate, however I was impressed by Harris\u2019 political stage presence. Have to say that either outcome would be positive. Great job to all the contenders though, and one more fuck you to the audience. https://t.co/S27rviLUKF \u201cI\u2019m going to beat Trump with love.\u201d ...And Trump\u2019s small heart grew three sizes that day. True. Good thing we\u2019re including time for the According to Jim audience to weigh in. https://t.co/lh5V0ZYAN1 @PeteButtigieg Best answer to that question, and hey, funniest too. Compare everything you\u2019re hearing tonight - ideas, proposals, grasp of the issues, cohesive communication -  with what we hear every day from the sitting president. Submitted without comment. More impressive candidates last night than tonight, but Buttigieg and Harris delivered in very different ways. My fear is that intellectual laziness will cause people to gravitate toward Biden alone as the \u201csafe\u201d choice. You\u2019ve met them all. Now do your homework. Chuck, this is a terrible question that oversimplifies things. This isn\u2019t Family Feud. RT @cmclymer: I can't stop thinking about Pete Buttigieg's answer to that question. It was completely unexpected. Vulnerable, honest, heart\u2026 @PeteButtigieg An extremely tough question about a critical issue - response was honest and without theatrics. Not something that can be answered in 60 seconds. Could devote the whole debate to it and still not scratch the surface. @PeteButtigieg And a great call on religion. This guy is indeed having a very good night. @PeteButtigieg only one who reminds us  that every developed country has both universal care and private insurance @PeteButtigieg is the most impressive candidate on this stage so far. No chest-thumping, no pandering to the crowd, no reaching for the applause button, just substance and intellect. When you slice through the theatrics of the room, this is the guy who stands out. @DNC I beg you in the name of all that is holy... lose the studio audience. They\u2019re grating, they\u2019re distracting, and they need to go. We want to hear from the candidates without grinding to a screeching halt twice a minute. Please, PLEASE make this change going forward. Hey debate audience - If you applaud and cheer and go \u201cwooo\u201d after every answer every time, it kinda... kinda diminishes the significance, doesn\u2019t it?  Yeah. Yeah it does. NBC, DNC, I truly have no idea who makes the call - but we folks at home don\u2019t care what the studio audience thinks. Lose \u2018em. We want to hear from the candidates. I truly wish they would get rid of the damn audience at these debates. If you add up all the seconds during which we grind to a halt so the crowd can applaud, it\u2019s a significant amount of precious time during which we could be hearing substantive dialogue from the candidates. Hey if you wanna take a break from politics, you can go check out seasons 1 &amp; 2 of #TheOrville on Hulu! It was water in the fucking desert. https://t.co/nDRSdERYy8 Yes, time allocation per candidate was lopsided - that was a problem.

Who did not plan to vote. The apathy was real. https://t.co/4D6QeFRtyQ Whatever you want to call it. But in a worst-case scenario, that apathy may ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade, among other things.

I only wish the same passion was evident at the polls last November, when we were electing the President who would appoint the next Justice (Merrick Garland debacle notwithstanding). Let us hope the turnout is better this fall. Deliberate, active divisiveness as a Presidential tool belongs solely to Trump. Today, he verbally savaged a small business via his Twitter account. Whether you think the Red Hen acted appropriately or not (and that\u2019s a layered, complex conversation) this fact is troubling. https://t.co/XDJxNR8IEX Not sure I would describe the current national atmosphere as \u201cpeaceful.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen the country more divided.
