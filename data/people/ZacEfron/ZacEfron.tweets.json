So pumped! RT @Dylan_efronfan: @ZacEfron when do you come to germany?? #askzacefron A little wrinklier?  Hopefully exactly like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.  Chasing down bad guys. RT @ObsessedW_Efron: @ZacEfron How do you imagine yourself in 30 years? #askzacefron I'll plan another one soon. IT WAS LAST NIGHT, BRO!  You didn't get the invite? RT @efronsource: YOOOOO Zac, can you invite all your fans in your house for a big party? @ZacEfron #askzacefron Xxxx My whole family went to the premiere.  It's totally weird.  I was sitting next to my mom and little brother for the love scenes.  Awkward! RT @mcrory77: #askzacefron Has your family seen The Lucky One yet?  Is it weird for them to see you on the big screen or are they used to it for them.  I probably wouldn't have made it through basic training. It did. It definitely taught me to respect the military. After getting a glimpse inside their world, I definitely gained a lot of respect RT @LMConroy97: @ZacEfron did your role as Logan give you a whole new respect for people in the army? #askzacefron Start local theater right away.  That's where I learned 90% of what I know today.  I'd start anywhere you can. RT @Jelenagelina What's your advice to people that wants to be an actress or actor when they grow up ? #askzacefron My cousin, Emily, got cancer.  Looks like she's in remission though - yay.  She helped me get started. RT @ObsessedW_Efron: @ZacEfron I really admire you fighting against cancer. How did you get involved with this project? #askzacefron I had Sour Patch Kids last night...I like green tea ice cream and banana flambe. Rachael Ray made these bomb poppy seed nutella cookies. RT @ElleShafer1: What is your favorite dessert? #askzacefron  @ZacEfron I've got a dog named Puppy.  He's an Australian Shepherd.  I'll post a picture later today. RT @MirandaStakeley: #askzacefron Do you have any pets or are you too busy? Since Ninja Turtles was canceled...Archer, Family Guy, South Park and Strawberry Shortcake. RT @ForeverZefron: #AskZacEfron best cartoon television show? Everything that's at Coachella right now.  Sad I'm not there.  But at least I get to chat with you guys! RT @wastedocean: @ZacEfron What type of music do you listen to? #askzacefron I honestly have so much fun in Australia.  I love to go there and surf. RT @ForeverZefron: #AskZacEfron favorite vacation spot? Testing video games.  Or a sushi chef.  But I love being an actor. RT @Jillybean683: @ZacEfron #askzacefron...if you weren't an actor what would you be doing... Yes, I can't wait to do another musical.  I'm just waiting for the right time and the right one. RT @tillyedss: #askzacefron will you ever do another musical again? :) I want to be Spiderman.  But I also want to be in X-Men: First Class. RT @zanessa12: #askzacefron if you could be any superhero who would you be? Sort of...Logan's a pretty amazing guy.  I'm trying to be more like him.  Always. RT @_Kristina2: #askzacefron ...  do you relate to the character you played in 'The Lucky One'? If so, how? Desperate Housewives and Gold Rush.  No, not really.  I like Life's Too Short and Game of Thrones. RT @samy108: @ZacEfron what kinds of television shows do you like to watch in your free time? #AskZacEfron Christopher Nolan. Zack Snyder. And Leonardo DiCaprio.  And Tom Hardy.  I've got 4. RT @MariaInVa: #askzacefron  top 3 people you would love to work with Totally.  His name is Rowdy.  He was incredibly well-trained, so it was fun to play and do tricks with him. RT @Mehreeen_x: #askzacefron did you get along with the dog while shooting #TheLuckyOne ;D The whole journey has been incredible.  Impossible to pick one moment.  I'm always filming in Canada...should be back soon. RT @MarilieAubry: What was the greatest thing about being in the Lucky One?:) Are you planning to come to Canada soon?&lt;3 Thanks #askzacefron Taylor's amazing.  I learned a lot from her.  She's the perfect Beth in The Lucky One. RT @juelzj: @ZacEfron How was it like working with Taylor Schilling? #askzacefron I don't really have a lucky charm.  I think my family is my lucky charm. RT @ObsessedW_Efron: @ZacEfron Like Logan, do you have a lucky charm? I have a letter Z to keep me away from bad feelings. #askzacefron People from my local theater.  They were in college, and they were multi-talented.  They could all act, sing and dance - I was amazed. RT @elle_wrightson: @ZacEfron #askzacefron who are your role models and who inspired you to become an actor? First I was afraid, then I hung out with the Marines and started to gain confidence. RT @ZacEfronTX: How did you feel when you got the part in The Lucky One? Also can you follow me were opening a fan site soon #askzacefron Absolutely.  So pumped!  Can't wait for everyone to see it.
