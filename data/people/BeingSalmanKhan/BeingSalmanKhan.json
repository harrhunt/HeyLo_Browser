I also strongly condemn those who are claiming my tweets are anti religious. I have always said I respect all faiths and I always will. I would like to unconditionally apologise for any misunderstanding I may have created unintentionally. My dad called &amp; said I should retract my tweets as they have the potential to create misunderstanding. I here by retract them. Many lives were lost in the Mumbai blasts. And I have repeatedly said the loss of one innocent life is equal to the loss of all humanity. I have not said or implied that Yakub Memon is innocent. I have complete faith in the judicial system of our country. I had tweeted that Tiger Memon should hang for his crimes and I stand by it.
