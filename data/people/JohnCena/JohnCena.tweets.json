I got to meet one of those heroes and hear her story. Lori Byrd is one of those heroes and I hope you learn more about her in this month's @goodhousemag https://t.co/pbP8IRWgIJ #HometownHeroes https://t.co/49uaGG7MvP Working well with others is a mandatory pillar of success. Not just in career but in all of life. Often people just focus on hard work instead of being aware and grateful to all those who help make things possible. The people you love and those that love you shouldn\u2019t want to change you, they should allow you to be the best you A beautiful look at what will be an incredible journey for movie goers this January. Honored to be included in such an amazing group and for such an epic tale. #DolittleMovie https://t.co/FqqpPyMSEk Many out there will make it a goal to make you feel inferior or inadequate strictly to try and cause you pain or embarrassment. Recognize it for what it is, their struggle with self. Rise above that hate. I want to say thank you to all who follow this platform for allowing me, recently, to keep you up to speed on projects in my life. Some you may dig, others may not be you. Just saying I\u2019m grateful for your patience to hear me out. None of any of this happens without you. Thanks. If someone takes a chance on you, prove them right. Give your all and seize the opportunity at hand. Know that you are working for something larger than self. Be diligent. Be grateful. Succeed or fail, it will say more about who you are than the most carefully constructed verse.

Elbow Grease vs. Motozilla is available TOMORROW!! https://t.co/UN4ENbyQsF https://t.co/qy5lGYBikJ Thank you @WillieGeist @TODAYshow! This is 2 friends talking who have great respect for each other and love talking @WWE and the message of #ElbowGrease: NEVER GIVING UP and TEAMWORK! I love this story and hope you do as well! https://t.co/i9qvYDmbsg https://t.co/eOc295qBOh A day enjoyed is never a day wasted. Life is not perfect, many people \u201cshare\u201d a filtered life without sadness, hardship, anger, shame, and other uncomfortable moments and emotions. Take this for what it is, what they are allowing you to see. Good luck to my @WWE family for the 1st episode of #SmackDown on @FOXTV. I\u2019ve learned a lot about family here at #Fast9 and while I\u2019ll be enjoying from afar, I\u2019m glad #FastAndFurious family icon @TheRock gets to FINALLY return home to electrify! An amazingly funny group of people (cast and writers) allowed me to be involved with this exciting new platform. Take a look, rather a listen, to the latest from @audible_com https://t.co/7YbSEN9sex \u201cElbow Grease\u201d taught young readers to be proud of who you are and Never Give Up! Now, join the #ElbowGrease family as they learn about the value of TEAMWORK in Elbow Grease vs Motozilla! https://t.co/ngoPoBzUa8 https://t.co/k2fvmw6v9R Thank you @TheEllenShow for allowing me a platform to discuss something close to my heart. The time is NOW, I will match ALL DONATIONS UP TO $1 MILLION to help @Fit_Ops achieve their goal of giving veterans #PurposeThroughFitness. \n\nDONATE HERE: https://t.co/XkgCkMdH5g https://t.co/RB6PPrKbUU Being on @TheEllenShow is always a special (and FUN) time for me but today you get to see us have fun AND make a HUGE announcement about a project close to my heart that has the ability to do real good for our veteran population. A chance to thank a hero and draw inspiration from his recovery and positive attitude. #WarriorOn https://t.co/woCvtrU5v8 Boundaries help people work to become their best selves. If you are closed off by the boundaries of another it can be painful, but also gives us a chance to examine ourselves. Most times those painful boundaries are what\u2019s needed and best for all involved. Create an environment where those around you are dedicated to purpose and feel comfortable to express how they feel, no matter what it entails (life, love, work), it\u2019s destined to change lives. You think 5th grade is a walk in the park, eh? Well, let\u2019s see if you think so after watching an all-new episode of #AreYouSmarter TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon! https://t.co/hYBf4wHBnM The feeling of anxious fear when breaking the manipulation of comfortably toxic situations is stifling. The good of the unknown is often never chosen for the comfort of toxicity. That first step is the biggest and toughest. Be brave. You can\u2019t finish a race you never start. Dance while the music is playing because eventually every song comes to an end. Comparison is the thief of joy If you\u2019re gonna make it a thing, make sure it\u2019s a thing. You can only make so many things a thing before no thing is worth any thing. Stop making others feel small just to feel bigger. Growth comes from work. Earn the right to grow. Does anyone have a phone \ud83d\udcf1 I can use? I\u2019m trying to use one my cheats for tonight!! An all-new episode of #AreYouSmarter tonight on @nickelodeon! https://t.co/8TeF3IHkbg Hurt people, hurt people. Don\u2019t dump your problems on others. Face them. If someone invites you into their \u201cworld\u201d, and you accept, don\u2019t see their world thru your eyes, see it thru theirs. Lasting bonds are forged thru empathy, respect, trust, and vulnerability. They are as valuable as the precious time spent to build them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. 2 very important words, no matter how they are delivered. If thrown away, it speaks volumes about the person apologizing. If sincere, they are the critical first step of trying to right a wrong. Never overlook the kindness of others. Kindness many times is the more difficult path to take. Make sure to acknowledge and show gratitude when those around and close to you choose to be kind. RT @JamesGunn: Don\u2019t get too attached. #TheSuicideSquad https://t.co/uITPhrDzz2 It\u2019s September. School is in full swing and I\u2019ve been working hard. I\u2019m studying in this library to see if I could become... Smarter than a 5th Grader! Are you? \nFind out tonight on @Nickelodeon! https://t.co/Mkds6oiWLS Kindness brings kindness out of others. Take the extra steps to be kind in disagreement and have faith that there is kindness in most all of us. Do whatever is needed to rid yourself of those that constantly show hatred and selfishness. Apology is an important step in forgiveness. Sometimes apology is given out of reflex or as an attempt to feel better about actions. Know what you apologize for. Understanding the pain of others will open up connective reconciliation, the opposite just creates more hardship. #NeverForget If you find yourself constantly publicly  \u2018picking apart\u2019 those you privately deem a success, maybe it\u2019s time to just give them credit for what they\u2019ve done and examine yourself. Attraction is what brings us together. Connection keeps us together. Find someone you are strongly attracted to, then be brave enough to allow connection and communication and the result is an unbreakable bond. $100,000 IS ON THE LINE!!! We\u2019re back with TWO all new episodes of #AreYouSmarter TONIGHT at 7p/6c, only on @Nickelodeon! \ud83c\udf4e https://t.co/tU8tP1AlU9 Elbow Grease is a brave truck who never gives up. Follow him and his family in this next exciting story of perseverance and teamwork! Now you can pre-order #ElbowGrease vs. Motozilla, and get a signed copy from me! https://t.co/2Iso8Nn16s The more you are exposed to someone, the more they become who they actually are. There\u2019s so much beauty all around us. Never shy away from an honest critique to help growth, but minimize or eliminate unnecessary negativity. It\u2019s amazing sometimes to see how much of life is lost to issues and people who\u2019s goal is to make us miserable. We all have those people who constantly tell us how poorly we live. Instead of adding to the negative with an argument, honestly evaluate their words. You\u2019ll find most times they belittle you because the are too afraid to belittle a mirror. If you find someone who makes you smile, even when you\u2019re trying to be grumpy, let them into your life. The connection could end up stronger than you ever imagined. Thank you \u2066@vindiesel\u2069 for helping me, challenging me, and openly making me feel part of the #FastAndFurious family #Fast9 What a ride it\u2019s been so far!!!! https://t.co/ycaIquy2le The first week of school has nothing on the first day of babysitting. \n\n\ud83d\udea8Warning\ud83d\udea8: I have NO idea what I\u2019m doing! #PlayingWithFireMovie\n@PlayingWFire https://t.co/HPeaBdso35 Never forget that you have value. Many people will try to manipulate you to either take your value or convince you it doesn\u2019t exist. YOU DO HAVE VALUE. Seek out those who understand and appreciate that. It will be one of the best choices you make. Allow yourself to love. What is under our control is our reaction and response to all that is out of our control. Constantly be a work in progress. Avoiding guilt is very easy. Passing blame to others forces us away from some possibly uncomfortable truths. Own your choices, actions, words. Be accountable for you. A long step away from \u201cdevelopmental system down in Florida.\u201d From the first #NXTArRIVAL on @WWENetwork to a weekly television show on @USA_Network. Congratulations to @WWE and @WWENXT! https://t.co/zJNt5FANBI Empathy, trying to see the world from the lives of others. Many times we rush to aggressively defend, stand up for ourselves, or put others down to feel superior. Take an extra breath, try and see all points of view before you take action. Be remembered because of what you stand for, not what you stand to gain. Wishing all in India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 #HappyIndependenceDay2019 Having a plan collapse is frustratingly difficult. It happens to us all. Instead of clinging to a collapsed idea, adapt to the now. You\u2019ll save energy, move forward with your life, and overcome the obstacle just put in front of you! \u201cIf you\u2019re the smartest person in the room, you\u2019re in the wrong room\u201d I love this quote and feel it extends past intellect. Try to surround yourself with those who push you. Succeed or fail, you\u2019ll be in a great environment to learn! Everyday we are faced with new challenges. Asking ourselves \u201cwhat is this challenge? What is it\u2019s purpose?\u201d Can be helpful in deciding which challenges we run towards, and those we save for another day. Wishing safety and unforgettable moments to the entire @WWE family for #SummerSlam! Savor every second, there are few things more magical than the @WWEUniverse The importance of doing \u201cnothing\u201d is often overlooked. Just recently we\u2019ve realized how valuable REST really is. Downtime or \u201cplaytime\u201d is the same. Don\u2019t feel guilty about having fun. Life\u2019s easier to deal with when you can laugh and wear a genuine smile. Spend less time worrying about those \u201cbetter\u201d than you and more time investing in bettering yourself. Do the work. Commit to purpose. Constantly evolve. Never give up. Failure is embarrassing, painful, and something most all of us never openly WANT to face. It is also the best way to learn, grow, and define who you are. Be brave enough to admit and face failure, and it may just reward you with the wisdom to achieve your dreams. Fear of the judgement of others is something most all of us have felt. Love who you are and you will find facing that fear is much easier. Over the years my beliefs have changed about many different things. I used to feel sleep was not mandatory. \u201cSleep when you\u2019re dead\u201d, no thanks. I sleep so I can live. Just one of the many things that can evolve. Constantly look within. Know who you are and who you are not. Many times we make everything about ourselves. Our reality revolves around us, but the world\u2019s does not. Handle your business, stay true to your values, be understanding enough to know the actions, choices, lifestyle, success/failure of others has little or nothing to do with you We all strive for certain things, but being jealous of others and attempting to make others jealous is a reflection of our own faults and insecurities. We will always have critics. I\u2019m grateful to all those critical of any choice I\u2019ve made. It encourages me to look within and determine the value of their thoughts. Some have helped me grow tremendously. Others are just a reflection of their own insecurities. Use your time and effort to chase and live your dreams, rather than spending valuable minutes convincing the world that you already do. Insecurities plague all of us. It is hard work to identify them. It\u2019s even harder work to improve on them. You are the sum of the company you keep. Search your last 10 texts. Are they happy? Or hurtful? If hurtful, ask why? Be brave enough to constantly evaluate the company you keep, AS WELL as the person in the mirror. All of us are uniquely different. Try to gravitate towards people that either have or have an understanding of what you value and believe in. Life, work, romance, ect. The \u201cperfect match\u201d is made of those who understand each other and are willing to be brave enough to grow. Searching for, and having friends that blindly agree with your opinions no matter what won\u2019t help you grow. Surround yourself with honest people who challenge your choices, openly can speak about values and beliefs. There is little to learn in always being right. If we feel physically unhealthy, what are we told to do? Change habits, get help, and put effort into change. Try to do the same mentally and spiritually. If you feel unhealthy, change your landscape, your connections, ask for help,  and put effort into those choices to change. The @WWEUsos working that \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a/\ud83d\udd90 #Whoa https://t.co/n4jufipJzp Giving advice is easy and often makes us feel good. Just make sure to speak from a place where you \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Today is a monumental day personally. Facing and overcoming deep rooted fears, forging ahead with the wonderful journey of life, and being brave enough to share feelings with those I love. Thank you to everyone who has made this moment possible. There is a big difference between aspiring to become better in your own life and despising others for choosing to live how they do. Degrading others takes time away from you focusing on becoming better. There is never anything wrong with being early. You can always \u201cpass the time \u201c but you can never make it up. When wishing those close to you happiness and joy, be genuine. https://t.co/B8CXtvOAGP \nWe all want to be heard but knowledge and wisdom come from listening and application. Be brave, listen and learn from all those around you. @vindiesel @Tyrese @Ludacris @MRodOfficial @JordanaBrewster @missnemmanuel #Fast9 What 3 things can make the toughest, fiercest Smokejumpers panic? A teenager and two small children. Can\u2019t wait for everyone to take this very messy and FUN ride with us! \n\nSo please enjoy the trailer for #PlayingWithFireMovie in theaters this November! \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/MSWmxF61Al \ud83e\udd2d\n #WorldEmojiDay Be more open minded and less judgmental. If you find yourself continually disappointed in the behavior of those close to you, it may be time to stand in a place where they can\u2019t get close. Be awesome. Make the rest of your life the best of your life. If you feel you have already peaked, you\u2019re right. Grateful for the opportunity, now.... time to #EarnTheDay #Fast9 #Respect https://t.co/jweQQOVcxO Very excited to begin laying the groundwork for a project that combines 2 things I care deeply about.

It is FAR from over and has greatly changed over the years. It has given me chances to be brave and vulnerable. Today #FastAndFurious journey begins. Fear, the unknown, growth, and maybe a haircut await. Adapt. Overcome. Never Give Up. RT @goodhousemag: We've partnered with @JohnCena for a contest honoring YOUR hometown heroes! Nominate a first responder in your life for a\u2026 Many times the things we don\u2019t want to hear are the things we need to hear. Own your everything. Know the difference between those who care about you, and those who care about what you can do for them. If you feel you reached the finish line, it\u2019s time to start another race. All of us have our set of life\u2019s \u201crules\u201d. Constantly revisit them, and know it\u2019s ok if they change. As we change, so should are values. Just don\u2019t let a new you get stuck following old \u201crules\u201d. Never stop dreaming. Chasing those dreams requires an incredible  amount of work. Never give up.

Sometimes \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d but I\u2019m always closer than you think. Love all of you and thank you for a wonderful evening. Tonight is another chance to be part of something so special #onedollarbet Never had one lesson BUT I learn so much every time I go to the #AreYouSmarter classroom! Check out episodes of @AreYouSmarter weeknights on @Nickelodeon at 7/6pm! https://t.co/gxjrBobEHp Everyday we are presented with situations where we can \u2018choose kindness\u2019. It may not always be possible to be kind, but remember, if you don\u2019t choose kindness, you DO choose the opposite. Own your everything. Our biggest competition is ourselves. Going out to a live audience no matter where, what, and why is always a thrill for me. Leaving \u201cgorilla\u201d for every episode of @AreYouSmarter was an exciting appearance because I got the chance to interact and LEARN from some very smart kids.... tune in tonight! @Nickelodeon https://t.co/7vu61UCGka Oh, I didn\u2019t see you there...I was shopping for antiques. But YOU should tune into @AreYouSmarter TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter https://t.co/dF8IdWT2cN Oh...did you get my email? I sent you an email. The subject was @areyousmarter premieres TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon at 7/6c! https://t.co/7ENkSuIPq8 The all-new @AreYouSmarter premieres TOMORROW \u2013 get ready to have your MIND. BLOWN. Don\u2019t miss it June 10 at 7/6c on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter \ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/qLz1AabPPL For nearly 20 years, the Fast Franchise has entertained fans and created some of the biggest cinematic moments in history. It\u2019s an incredible honor to join this franchise and this family. https://t.co/7GFzDsX8sl Never forget all those who embarked on the great crusade, 75 years ago today #DDay75 https://t.co/NKwZUUMvYq The worst feeling in the world is to feel used and lied to by someone you trusted. That\u2019s happened to us all. Don\u2019t close yourself off to trust, or love. If you never give \u2018trust\u2019 or \u2018love\u2019. You will never get trust or love in return. Your happiness does not require the consent of others. Be happy. Stay tough. \nHappy Birthday, Diego. https://t.co/RYmipzsUfd An awesome first day at @BookExpoAmerica. \nConversation with the educators, library owners, and those who work with young readers all centered around a growth mindset. Excited to see everyone tomorrow to continue our discussion and meet more of you who play this important role. https://t.co/jLrDHhJ7a9 It\u2019s amazing sometimes the situations we can become comfortable with. Talking ourselves into comfortable complacency. Be brave, if you want or need a change, make it. Thinking too long will just keep you right where you are. Opportunity is never a hand out. It is a chance. It\u2019s a chance to work harder than you already do. Welcome opportunity, and thru those chances you will succeed, fail, but most importantly gain wisdom and forge a a better you! Never forget all those who\u2019ve made the ultimate sacrifice for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Earn each day. #MemorialDay https://t.co/WNti0GyhPa I can\u2019t get this elephant\u2019s voice out of my head. Literally. Because it\u2019s mine. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m always eating pistachios. @WonderfulNuts https://t.co/uKmeOfIvKF Never underestimate the power of an act of kindness. In a day and age of trying to share everything with everyone, find the someone who makes you feel like everyone else disappears. Listen to a preview of the #ElbowGrease audiobook, now available narrated by yours truly and complete with sound effects! Find out more via @PRHAudio: https://t.co/KT7grkzIb5 https://t.co/INUP8Zdh7L Best part of the all-new @AreYouSmarter? THE CLASS.

Can't wait for you to meet them all June 10 on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter https://t.co/5N5HpK8U3x True Story: It took 10 days to record Ernie\u2019s voice. Nine of them were wasted because THIS elephant wouldn\u2019t stop munching pistachios in the booth. @WonderfulNuts https://t.co/VTetQV7DrP In a day and age of filters and showcasing only \u201cperfect moments\u201d, never lose the real you. In trying to be liked by everyone, don\u2019t become no one. We all struggle. Don\u2019t feel you need to struggle alone. Asking for help is not weakness. It can make a world of difference. Life is a state of constant motion. Whether that motion is forward or backwards is up to the one living the life. Kindness is a wonderful example of tolerance and acceptance for the existence of those around us. It\u2019s also something we directly control. Some life changing moments for me, first time I picked up \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, first @WWE match, first @MakeAWish and THIS WEEKEND. @fit_ops Tears, smiles, honor, bravery, connection, and purpose among other things! Can\u2019t have \u2018life changers\u2019 without LIFE. I love you Mom. #HappyMothersDay There are certain moments in life that answer questions of purpose and assure us that we are where we need to be. This week, especially now, has been just that. Thank you to all involved in such a life changing series of events. Truth can be an interesting thing. Because we all view it thru our own lens. We are often quick to judge the truth of others, from a lens that is not theirs, yet hesitate and ignore the action and truth of our own. Own your everything. Believe in others who help you to believe in yourself. \nWhen the task is difficult, the triumph is greater.\nAbsolutely and incredibly proud to be partnering with @performixdriven and @Fit_Ops to help those who've served our nation. \n#EarnedNeverGiven #KeepPerfecting #FitOps https://t.co/ZwTCkEHvi9 It\u2019s very easy to shift blame for our own mistakes. Own your everything Beware those who think you owe them happiness at the expense of your own well being. Very excited to say that I have received an invite to what I believe will be an event that will change my life. I\u2019m certain I will cry my eyes out and simultaneously harness the power of a lightning bolt! You know who you are, see you soon, and thank you. Just finished such an amazing experience where I was surrounded by a great group of gifted young people that made me a better human being! Learned SO much!!!! Thank you classmates!! Silence can often be our most valuable asset, for many, it\u2019s also the most difficult to use. Emotions never get the best of us, emotions are us. Be accountable for your emotions and actions. Own your everything. The term \u201ceasier said than done\u201d is 100% true. Doing of the deed is the hard part, it\u2019s just a matter of if you\u2019re willing to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d, because it\u2019s much easier said, than done. Own your everything. Never give up. Thank you, Kurt. \n\nWork as hard as you can. Constantly surround yourself with those better than you. Make mistakes and learn from them. Never give up! (Ankle lock is an exception, it\u2019s true!) @RealKurtAngle \n\nhttps://t.co/Q3jLcWnP6B Opportunity can arise when we least expect it. Always presenting itself with a chance, but normally accompanied with fear and sacrifice. Face those fears, make that sacrifice, get uncomfortable and seize those opportunites! Win or lose, you will learn from every one!! ..and never give up! No matter what you chase, it is NOT easy, even when you enjoy it! Because we all have good and bad days, embrace the good and fight like hell thru the bad. Never give up. 30 years. Straight. And I\u2019m just getting warmed up! Own Your Everything! https://t.co/4s0CtcpPaD ..30 years of overcoming failures, literally facing the man in the mirror, and knowing that growth will come thru pain and discomfort, and never giving up. Find your passion. The thing you can do for 30 years and hope for 30 more. And chase it. With the \u201cbest you\u201d everyday.... https://t.co/s9lkx5KMd4 ...I found my passion for fitness by beginning a dedicated workout/nutrition program at (yes this is correct \ud83d\ude33) age 12. This year I celebrate 30 years of chasing the unattainable, and never giving up. 30 years of pushing beyond limits, never giving up.... https://t.co/mUCQszf1zI Turned 42 today. Shot these and realize that by sharing I open the door towards ANY comments you have. But I share these for the message within them. WE ARE THE SUM OF OUR ACTIONS. 42 is usually a forgettable # but it\u2019s special for me......... https://t.co/CpAsDgbGYj You are the one responsible for your pain and joy. Own your everything. I was super nervous and had many moments of doubt, but thank you @TheEllenShow and your amazing audience and guests for giving me a chance to face my fears and be part of such a wonderful experience! Unforgettable! https://t.co/YxiFPEaSij Over the years, @TheEllenShow has given me the wonderful gift of friendship. That and many, many gallons of @TicTac\u2019s ... but today, she is giving me her show! That\u2019s right I\u2019m HOSTING today\u2019s episode of Ellen! So nervous. So excited. So not trying to break anything! @TheEllenShow \n\nhttps://t.co/QxrcCHOPTM ...\ud83e\udd2b\ud83c\udf78... #asmr #ProudlyAmerican #SkyyVodka #ad21+ https://t.co/ZxFgjPwCVv Do not ignore truth. Face it. Many times it\u2019s uncomfortable but ignoring it only provides temporary comfort and creates a bigger problem in the future Favorite tracks off Persona ..\nIntro aka Persona (love the Super Mario Bros \u201ccoin sample\u201d)and Dionysus. Greek god of wine making... yeah that\u2019s a good one for me @bts_bighit @BTS_twt #BTS The power and emotion of sport is amazing.  #TheMasters There will be those who voice their opinions about your choices. Always consider the source before you let it affect you. More often than not they have little business evaluating your life, and are just looking for attention or a reaction. Both would be a waste of your time. Strive to have friends that will help you face truth and give you priceless honesty in uncomfortable times. Thank you to everyone out there who does this for me. Means everything. You know who you are. Thank you. Instead of trying to find the right person, try to be the right person. Get to a point where you love yourself, and you might be surprised at the company you choose to keep. Happy #Wrestlemania35 day!! @WWE @WWEUniverse Hang on to things you love as long as you possibly can, also understand the cycle of life. Everything has an end. Hanging on past the end can lead to many trying and challenging moments Surprise! Congratulations and THANK YOU for the years of entertainment, smiles, laughs, and of course, wine. Looking forward to the next \u201cevolution!\u201d @KathieLGifford #CheerstoKLG https://t.co/avka6adTbZ One chapter ends, another begins, the story never stops. Own your everything. Never Give Up. We all have times of fear, guilt, and anxiety. All of us. A special message from Agent Burns: #BumblebeeMovie is now on Blu-ray! https://t.co/OghGsgxKoN \ud83d\udc1d https://t.co/M3T4KTCvgK Never Give Up. Congrats Colin, your hard work starts now!! Good luck man!! https://t.co/IcgMi83vXX Search for someone you connect so strongly with, that you miss them the moment they are gone. Be present, live and love the now. \u2018You never know what you got, until it\u2019s gone\u2019 leads to some difficult reflection. Know what you have while you have it. Find joy from the ups, downs, beginning, middle and end. That way memories are fond, not regretful. Opportunity does not happen everyday. When it does it will ALWAYS involve tough choices, hard work, and sacrifice. When opportunity does knock, ANSWER! And then be prepared to give your best! When searching for someone to make you smile and feel good inside, be sure the first person who does that is the one looking back at you in the mirror. Never fear losing something you don\u2019t possess Attitude is a boomerang, what ever you throw out there, it will come back your way. Allow life to happen. If you stop giving reasons things shouldn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll be amazed at what does happen. Love, without effort, is not enough to keep any relationship together There are many who work behind the scenes to make @WWE the massive brand it is, but few have touched so many lives like Sue. Congratulations to a person who has made dreams come true and has given hope to families around the world. #WWEHOF #WarriorAward https://t.co/BviKEz0iig In the toughest of times we face the toughest of choices. Whenever possible, choose love. I have often talked about being the sum of the company we keep. @RealJohnCMartin is a close friend who has been on an amazing journey of development and dedicates his life to lifting the spirts of others. Love you John. Grateful to have you in my life. https://t.co/ojBtuWrC8k Congrats on an unbelievable achievement! Hard work, great attitude and passion pay off! Good luck!! https://t.co/wRGr07jZu5 Improvement is never easy, or comfortable. Strive to improve, always. Don\u2019t normally do this but this is a well written piece that speaks volumes to the wonderfully gifted and hard working current @WWE roster! What an amazing time to be a member of the @WWEUniverse https://t.co/xb0IdqcZBQ It might not always be possible, but each day try to do a good thing for someone with expecting nothing in return. Posting again just to make sure all can access. Cried tears of joy and smiled ear to ear learning about \u201cRoz\u2019s\u201d story. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. https://t.co/WeWop6bBHk Well done \u2066@theCHIVE\u2069 what a special young lady \u201cRoz\u201d is. Good people doing things for good people. Amazing story and hope everyone has the time to watch this. You will smile and cry with joy. https://t.co/abpGpxeqc8 When trying a new skill, a point of failure will be reached very quickly. Don\u2019t give up. Especially if you enjoy it. Press on though the tough times! What can be accomplished with persistence is amazing! Never give up. A new day, a new week. Filled with challenge, opportunity, connection, setback, good, bad, and all in between. Own your all. Earn the day. And when times do get tough, Never give up. Confidence in ability, hard work, and persistence through the difficult times is a major factor that determines long term victory from defeat. Love lacks logic. That\u2019s why I love it. Can\u2019t wait! You are an inspiration to me and it will be an honor! You embody #NeverGiveUp #onedollarbet https://t.co/25ZSS5hpsO No one is irreplaceable. Strive to be unforgettable. Do your best to be your best. Sometimes those close to you will disagree with your choices. Know the difference between those who are trying to help you grow, and those who are trying to bring you down. Own your everything. I\u2019m sitting at a picnic table now BUT will be at @StrandBookStore in Union Square, NYC on April 5th at 4pm taking photos and meeting fans of #ElbowGrease! \ud83d\ude97\nUntil then, I\u2019ll just be sitting at this picnic table. https://t.co/h1X95Cqg4c Stay humble. Stay hungry. Own your everything. Bad decisions are a part of life. We all make them. Own those actions instead of manipulating the situation to avoid feeling guilt or shame. Projecting shame or guilt onto others is just another bad decision. Perception sometimes clouds us from the obvious. Emotions can blur logic, even when it meets us eye to eye. We often talk ourselves into a perception other than the obvious to cater to our needs, but if it looks like knife, has a blade, and cuts, chances are it\u2019s a knife. We are defined by our actions. Telling someone something and then doing the opposite makes the words meaningless. Being a \u201cperson of their word\u201d simply means saying something and doing what you say. A very simple, yet admirable quality to strive for. Success is a vehicle for people to become who they really are. The ride up is never as fast as the ride down. Work hard. Never give up. Always be accountable for your actions. Own your everything. I am grateful enough to have, only a few, but a few real friends in my life that will be honest with me if I\u2019ve made some sort of mistake, then help me work to correct it, and do not take umbrage when the tables are turned. You know who you are. Love you. Thank you. Real superheroes exist. Back and with strength and purpose! It\u2019s your yard Roman. Your time is most certainly NOW! https://t.co/jEBDtQm39W This was very motivating to wake up to. Never too late to strive for greatness. \u201cRing the Bell\u201d is an honored tradition \u2066@HardNocksSouth\u2069 when you achieve what seems to be impossible. Thanks to the entire \u2066@FordhamBaseball\u2069 squad! #NeverGiveUp https://t.co/8fGsMAsx7r Taking stock of your surroundings shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Things, times, and people change. Not to mention changes we may go thru. Never be afraid to take a step back, evaluate yourself, your choices, your goals, and your relationships as it pertains to your being and joy Speaking tells people what we know. Listening allows us to learn. Keep perspective on when to use each one. RT @VinceMcMahon: .@WWERomanReigns (aka Joe Anoa'i) will address the status of his fight with leukemia this Monday on Raw. #fighter #proud\u2026 In trying to be everywhere at once to do everything, just make sure not to end up nowhere doing nothing at all. Own your life choices, both the good and bad. Own your everything. Passion for something can be productive. Obsession with something may be the opposite. They say \u201cwisdom comes with age,\u201d but you should never doubt how intelligent young men and women can be. Ready to bring back this educational and FUN show. It\u2019s time to find out... #AreYouSmarter?! @Nickelodeon https://t.co/JSn7kwt2DT I know #ValentinesDay has very mixed reviews. But celebrating love, that certainly IS special. Love is a powerful, wonderful thing that evokes all your emotions and shouldn\u2019t be contained to 1 day. Never fear telling those you love \u201cI love you\u201d today IS a good day to start RT @randomhousekids: In @JohnCena's second picture book Elbow Grease is back and about to face off against the gnarly monster machine Motoz\u2026 All my life I've been privileged to be a part of many great \"teams.\" If I'm in a @WWE ring, on set, or spending time with loved ones, who I am is shaped by the wonderful people beside me. These experiences have helped to create a very special project ... #ElbowGreasevsMotozilla! https://t.co/hWRkFBluVp Everyone that comes into your life is either a blessing or a lesson. Define what you\u2019d like to achieve. Work each day towards that goal. Know who you are, and embrace every bit of it. Always strive to evolve, just never be anything but yourself. Deny someone what they really want, observe them through hard ship, or give them power... and you will find out what the true nature of their character really is. We all have our perception of truth. This becomes our reality. In times of emotional stress don\u2019t cloud truth too much with unfair bias. Do your best to look at life for what it is, so you can take the steps to make it what you think it should be. Always take ownership of mistakes. Lessons can be learned from even the smallest of things, like proofreading or knowing the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09 Thanks to all out there keeping me accountable. Live. Learn. Love life. If your going to gamble, bet on yourself. Brave chances backed up by constant effort, can lead to amazing things. My apologies to all the real football fans out there \u26bd\ufe0f! Hope everyone enjoys the @NFL version of #WrestleMania #SuperBowlLlll and make sure to check out @WWE #HalftimeHeat during halftime! Enjoy Hoping everyone enjoys the #WrestleMania of football. Happy #SuperBowlSunday Compare yourself to yourself. Time spent trying to be like someone or be someone else may take focus away from who you really are. \u201cAm I better than I was yesterday, last month, last year?\u201d \u201cAm I moving forward towards my life goals?\u201d Never stop asking. Never stop learning. No one is perfect. When looking in the mirror, own your flaws, and shortcomings. Know you are strong enough to work on them, learn from them, grow from them. The more often you can look within and take ownership of both good and bad, the better potential for growth and joy. We always will give ourselves reasons for not facing difficult challenges in life, the base of many of those reasons is fear. Fear of what will happen to us if we try. If we try, we will learn, grow, fail, succeed, feel, and live. If we don\u2019t, we will always simply just wonder. Violation of trust is difficult. Faith is put into an idea with the belief that all parties will be honest. When it fails it can lead to feelings of being used, manipulated, betrayed, ect. Never fight that \ud83d\udd25 with \ud83d\udd25 It\u2019s better to have trust broken, than to be on the other side Control the controllable. If you are going thru a rough patch due to the actions of others, ask yourself, what things under your control can be changed. You can\u2019t make someone be anything but themselves, but you can control how you handle what life throws your way. It\u2019s harder and harder to keep secrets these days...excited we get to share this news today!! @netflix https://t.co/LxTFOlHrED Setbacks are a large part of life. People often say \u201cwhat a bad time to get hurt\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened to me now\u201d ask yourself, is there a good time to get hurt? Or be setback? Setbacks are just another chance to find triumph! Never give up! Sometimes we hide honesty because we think it will be hurtful to those who would hear. I don\u2019t understand this.  Lying is always more hurtful than truth. Be empathetic and honest but have the difficult conversation. We all want someone or something to blame when things don\u2019t go our way. Try taking that blame. Face your setbacks and fears head on, learn from them, and make a stronger, smarter, and better you! Working on every part of #BumblebeeMovie was great because I believed in the cast, the crew, &amp; most importantly, the STORY of the film. Excited to see how well the audience in China and throughout the WORLD have taken to the story of \ud83d\udc1d! \nXie Xie Zhongguo! https://t.co/vVvfR62F6Q Do the people you surround yourself with encourage you, or burden you? We tend to take on the traits of those we spend the most time with. Do your best to find an environment of encouragement and growth. Being upset by the happiness of others seems like wasted time. We should all strive to be happy, and if someone else\u2019s happiness is hurtful to you, look within, ask why, and hopefully you\u2019ll not only find answers, but maybe find happiness yourself Never fear the moments where all appears lost. It only is if you allow it. Focus, regroup, move onward. (Even if at first you must move slightly backwards \ud83e\udd2b) Committing to a purpose means doing everything you\u2019ve ever heard about hard work. Long days, sacrifices, dedication to cause. But if it\u2019s purpose with passion and love, it will never seem like \u201cwork\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing when those you have opened up to attempt to use your vulnerability as weakness to make you feel pain, guilt or shame. Stay strong, be empathetic, but also understand the situation and move forward accordingly. I used gravity boots for the first time yesterday. Turned my whole world upside down. Passion, purpose, and love. Fill your existence with these three things, and I\u2019m willing to wager you have many more good days than you do bad ones. Reflection. Prediction. Resolution. Awareness. Mixed in with some plain old living! #HappyNewYears #Happy2019 Wishing all out there a safe and happy #NewYearsEve2018 What\u2019s up w the HAIR?! @WWE I\u2019ve tried to tell you!

Bumblebee looks exactly like I remember him! @bumblebeemovie https://t.co/jfYvvyD1Ye Dealing with negativity is part of life and is never fun. It\u2019s grip is always the strongest when it comes from those you hold close. Do your best to address those difficult moments. If they continue, maybe don\u2019t hold those people so close. Nothing of any personal value is ever given away. It is earned. In chasing our passion if we wind up in a difficult stretch, our attitude can be the difference. \u201cWhether you think you can or you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right\u201d-H.

If you feel in your heart and your head you\u2019ve done right, pay no attention to any of this. It\u2019s just people trying to manipulate you to go backwards.

As long as you have life, you are capable of great things. Moments of want are very interesting because what comes after them defines how strong the urge really is.

I cannot wait for you all to see it in theaters this Christmas. #BumblebeeMovie https://t.co/lTmmlVUhjE These next few days we give thanks and recognize all those who take the oath to make the ultimate sacrifice for inalienable rights. Thank you Veterans everywhere for what you\u2019ve done, do, and will continue to do. #VeteransDay #VeteransDayWeekend Cannot wait to bring #ElbowGrease to LA! Share the excitement and fun of this wonderful story on December 10th at 7pm at the @BNEventsGrove! https://t.co/Xqu3w1jWS2 https://t.co/GDpEHeFm5W RT @ReadBrightly: Vroom, vroom! It\u2019s time for another episode of Brightly Storytime, our read-aloud video series for kids. Get your engines\u2026 Do not hold onto a poor decision just because you spent lots of time to make it. Taking an honest look at yourself should be done often and means coming to grips with some great, and some difficult things. Being able to move forward and improve after you genuinely identify the difficult and the great, can lead to immeasurable growth. For those out there who find themselves saying \u201cI just want to be happy\u201d remember to ask yourself what it is that makes you \u201chappy\u201d. Many have no idea, they just want \u201chappiness\u201d. Do your best to define it, then make choices to work towards it. The phrases \u201cI love you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, and \u201cI forgive you\u201d are extremely powerful when said with genuine meaning. If wasted and simply said without truth, they are equally powerful but in the most negative way imaginable. Take accountability for your actions and choices. Know that not everyone will see your point of view. If you offend anyone, apologize and ask for forgiveness. The \u201cunknown\u201d is a wild place because it is what is says. Many times our fear keeps us from experiencing the \u201cunknown\u201d. Be brave, know that difficulty and uncertainty lie ahead, and don\u2019t let your fears keep you from what could be your greatest moments Thank you for letting me and all the characters from #ElbowGrease spend Friday evening with you! https://t.co/XxczSYDoua https://t.co/bmVVhqJ3kt Don\u2019t give up on something you enjoy just because of the pressure from others around you. Your life is yours to live and you only get one. Make sure to try and enjoy it! Tonight is a special night not only for women in @WWE, but every person who\u2019s ever been a fan of our industry. Congratulations to all participating, I\u2019m excited to watch tonight as a fan. #WWEEvolution https://t.co/veSIr4wawz Have you heard the legend of Patty Kayake?

But more often than we think, our limits are self-imposed\u201d Angela Duckworth It is very difficult to face those who cause you pain and ask for sympathy. Understand that we all go through many trials in life and just because you are hurt by someone, should not close you off to the fact the may be hurt as well. No actors.

But we CAN do it. #NeverGiveUp\nWatch the livestream: https://t.co/qj66VK0Rju https://t.co/NVpeS19Ona It\u2019s easy and often we talk about the \u201cwins\u201d in our lives, how often do we talk about the \u201closses\u201d? There is much more to be learned from failure than from victory yet with most victory is discussed and failure is privatized. Try the reverse, you may learn something new. \u2018Courage - strength in the face of pain or grief.\u2019 You have given us your everything including a courageously vulnerable moment. We, your WWE family, give you all of our love and support. #ThankYouRoman #NeverGiveUp Believe in what you say, and what you do. If you say and do things just to create an image of what you want people to think, over time they will eventually see who you really are. If you give your absolute all to something, no matter the result, you should be at peace knowing you couldn\u2019t work any harder. Hearing hurtful things from those you hold close is difficult. Some are trying to help by being brave enough to give you truth, others are just plain hurtful to cover their insecurities. Be humble and aware enough to know the difference. The best part of #ElbowGrease has been seeing how much everyone is enjoying it with their loved ones. Excited to be in Boston on 10/26 to continue the fun! https://t.co/nsD1JTz3KO A truly surreal moment....#ElbowGrease is a @nytimes #1 Best Seller! Thank you to everyone who made this a reality.

Anything can be negotiated it takes knowing your needs, listening to the needs of others, and coming up with a resolve that all feel is fair. Ive always enjoyed this quote \u201cPerhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.\u201d Anton Chekhov \u2018This person would be perfect IF\u2019 is simply an attempt to change and control people. This is a waste of precious time. Focus on you and honestly ask yourself \u2018do the people around me know and love me for me?\u2019 If the answer is yes, you\u2019re around the right folks! \ud83d\ude0a Fear is what prevents us from being ourselves because of how we think others might view our choices. It will always be there. Strength comes from being brave enough to face fear, recognize it, and overcome it to let YOU shine through! I am guilty of this myself but I\u2019m changing my view now. Hard work and persistence are needed for success, but so is rest and recovery. Busy periods of time will come, but never sell short recharging yourself. I\u2019m NOT on \u201cthe grind 24/7\u201d because rest is more productive. Nothing lasts forever. When doing something you love make sure to be present and enjoy it. That way if and when it ends, you can look back with fond memories instead of regret. RT @bumblebeemovie: This Christmas, every hero has a beginning. Watch the new #BumblebeeMovie trailer now, and \ud83d\udc9b this Tweet to receive spec\u2026 Do good work. Stay true to your values and what you believe in. Be patient. Know that you will fail. Get back up. Be accountable for your actions. Embrace the uncomfortable. Never give up. Some people face change. Some people change face. Opportunity never presents itself when your \u201cready\u201d, so just be \u201cready\u201d to be uncomfortable and take chances. It\u2019s easy to stay comfortable and play safe. See the opportunity, embrace the fear, take the chance. You never know. It\u2019s human nature to judge, especially in today\u2019s culture of sharing everything, but instead of categorizing someone based on a post or an image, get to know them and the way they live their life. Your opinion will be much more accurate and less negative. Weakness IS a strength. With so many worried about being perfect, vulnerability and showing weakness is the absolute key to growth. Yes you will have a tough road but opening up is one of the best ways to learn about life. Being ridiculed, judged, and belittled is unfortunately commonplace whenever you decide to face your fears, but when it comes from those who are supposed to care about you ask yourself if they really do? 10/6 #WWESSD \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE #RAW @WWEUniverse @WWENetwork #SDLive \u95ea\u7535\u62f3\u5934 https://t.co/20gi7H3Ni4 The great thing about social connection is it gives us all a voice. It also allows us to easily see those that squander that gift by choosing to use that voice for negativity. Asking for help is a wonderful process that accomplishes many great things. Realize you don\u2019t know everything, trust those you ask to help you develop, and learn more about who you are and what you value most. Happiness is achieved by living your life, your way. Others may not agree with your actions or choices, remember its YOUR life, not theirs. Go forth, live, be happy. What better place to learn about #ElbowGrease than in a place I work very hard in every week! Excited for you all to read it! https://t.co/Xqu3w12lts https://t.co/ougvR1t5fr The only person you need to prove yourself to is you. 10/6 \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE  #WWESSD We are the creators of our own reality. With that power comes the responsibility to be accountable for the reality we create. Do not expect others to share your viewpoint. Our lives are made up our actions and choices. Don\u2019t ever expect everyone to just \u2018see things your way\u2019. Be accountable for you, explain your actions the best you can, and if people still don\u2019t understand, allow them that choice. Many of us fear rejection. Rejection is simply a difference in opinion. Next time you get rejected, instead of feeling embarrassed or afraid, ask \u201cwhy?\u201d It\u2019s amazing what can be learned about yourself and others. Love what you do. If you don\u2019t, and can\u2019t suddenly quit. Find out what it is that you love and take steps everyday to move towards that. Love what you do. It\u2019s the easiest way to do great work!! So many times we hang on past experiences or spin our wheels about what\u2019s to come that we fail to live in, and enjoy the NOW. Memories and foresight are special, but never downplay the \u201cnow\u201d. It is the place where we make memories and dreams come true. You cannot expect someone to share your goals when they do not understand and share your values. What a wonderful night in \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 @WWE @WWEUniverse thank you so so much for allowing to perform at #WWEShanghai already back at @EyeOfJackieChan set for more \ud83c\udfa5 Thank you #JCStuntTeam for teaching me the art of Ba ji quan! \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a #TheDoomiest Almost time. \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE 6thMOD #TheDoomiest https://t.co/OV02oi3aPX Well done @SD_Southpaw ! \ud83d\udcb5 #OneDollarBet this is a bet I really hope to lose! #NeverGiveUp https://t.co/gzE6ejHxRk &gt;4 Days \ud83d\udc4a\u26a1\ufe0f @WWE \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 6thMOD.. aka #TheDoomiest https://t.co/G2qmWiQowP So excited for everyone to read #ElbowGrease and for the chance to meet YOU @BNUnionSquareNY in New York City on October 9th and @FreeLibrary in Philadelphia, PA on October 12th! https://t.co/R9P2wq28Cd https://t.co/FGrIF6s3Q1 Love yourself. There will always be hatred. Striving to be better is wonderful but ALWAYS #LoveYourself . And know the difference between self love and self absorption. One will help you, one will not. Failing to meet expectations can lead to some tough emotional territory. That\u2019s why giving your all to something is important. If for some reason your expectations aren\u2019t met or you don\u2019t meet that of others, yes it\u2019s tough, but little else could be done. We are in a culture of sharing, and of critique. Be comfortable with you. Critics will always attack your achievements or failures with heartless ferocity. Use the negativity to make you a stronger, better you. Keep doing. Keep sharing.

Those who think they know you will say you\u2019ve let them down. Those who really know you will encourage your attempt to grow. #EmbraceTheUncomfortable #RiseAboveHate #NeverGiveUp I have the utmost respect for anyone who can operate at a high capacity amidst adversity. Being constantly reminded of all the reasons you will fail, and still always rising to the occasion shows true dedication and passion. It\u2019s now always about who ... it\u2019s about what. #ElbowGrease is a story of hard work and trying your best. ANYONE can do it.

Communicate them to those you love. Getting to the roots of what you value and believe is both a foundation to fix wrongs and a key to happiness. Life will be filled with failure, especially for the brave who put themselves out there. When failure happens, look first at yourself, because this is all you can really control. Assume the burden, build yourself stronger, and be ready for the next challenge! To all of India #HappyIndependenceDay2018 No one has it all figured out. \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE 9/1 #WWEShanghai Honesty is the foundation of unlocking your potential. We often try to project image an that we are \u201cperfect\u201d. No one is. Honesty with self and those around us allow us a chance to improve ourselves and our surroundings. Trying to be \u201cperfect\u201d is just a version of dishonesty. You are the sum of your actions, not your words. You do NOT want to throw a beer at a robot. Ever. See the first episode of #DallasAndRobo streaming now on YouTube! https://t.co/iToj0JokbM https://t.co/QgXty4ohL5 The promises you make mean nothing compared to those you keep. Be vulnerable. It shows you for you. People will judge, disagree, and downright despise. But you will be you. Most of those who judge, disagree, or despise do so because they struggle with vulnerability themselves. Never stay in your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d too long.

Routine allows for many comforts and conveniences, but can prevent you from learning valuable things about you. Do something different, or something you always wanted to. \u201cI see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on the frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words.\u201d Hesiod 8th century B.C. Just because youth is often misunderstood doesn\u2019t mean the future isn\u2019t bright! Trust is a powerful thing. \u201cdon\u2019t trust anyone\u201d closes the door on the experience of life. Learn to trust people, good and bad can come of this, but the more you trust, the more you get to know people for who they really are. The 6th move of doom. \nReady for #WWEShanghai.\nSept 1st. People will speak about you. People will try to speak for you. People aren\u2019t you. YOUR voice is the most powerful when it comes to your values and beliefs. Always be accountable for your voice, and sometimes the best use of it, is silence. #BetterThanSexIn3Words Love. (You can have the other 2 words, I feel all we need is love \ud83d\ude09) \u201cWant to change the world? Find someone to help you through life.\u201d William McRaven. So grateful to each and every special person who has, is, and continues to help me through life. I always promise to give my best #NeverGiveUp and #EarnTheDay Never fear trying, but never be blind to the lessons of failure If you can learn something from your experiences, good and bad, you will live with little to no regret. In times of crisis you find out who is your friend and who isn\u2019t. Anyone who supports or praises you in triumph then abandons or ridicules you in crisis isn\u2019t worth giving your time to.

This can be a very dangerous word. We want so badly, many times, to shift blame to others due to the ease of not being accountable. When searching for who to blame, your first look should be in the mirror.

Listening to IT instead of the many voices around us can be a path to happiness. Listen to your \u201cheart\u201d everyone else, is often just confusing noise.

I love you #HappyMothersDay Try never to make a decision when you are tired, hungry, or angry. We all have a story and we all want to be heard, but it\u2019s amazing what can be learned if you take a moment and listen to those around you. Some of us long for things until we get them, then feel still unsatisfied. Being driven is great. Not knowing thyself, not so great. Action has consequence. An extra second of thought can help you see the action, and consequence. \u201cA game of chess is like a sword fight, you must think first, before you move.\u201d Learn from your mistakes.
