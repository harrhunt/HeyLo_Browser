The app appears to be using its current No. 1 status to get users to buy an expensive, automatically renewing subscription. Users are prompted to agree to a three-day \"free trial\" in order to try the lookalike feature. The app's sharp rise also raised questions about the app's origins. Its developer, called \"Ticket to the Moon, Inc.,\" has not released any other apps, and there's very little information about the company online. You might want a trendy app to tell you that you look like Courtney Cox, but at what cost? A mysterious Kardashian-endorsed selfie app, Gradient, exploded onto the App Store charts last week. But users are complaining about big credit card charges. It's been dominating social media thanks to its \"look like\" feature, which compares your selfies to photos of celebrities.

It can be maneuvered across the board\u2019s surface by just one user, or a large group. Gigantic summoning is indeed a possibility. The board - known officially as \u201cOuijazilla\u201d - measures 3,168 square feet and weighs over 9,000 pounds. It was constructed out of 99 sheets of plywood and 20 gallons of wood stain.
