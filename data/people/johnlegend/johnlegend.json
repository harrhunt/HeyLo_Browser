We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff. Her sentence shouldn't be fewer years. It should be ZERO. It's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. It's insane we locked a woman up for 5 years for sending her kid to the wrong school district.  Literally everyone involved in that decision should be ashamed of themselves Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up.  Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill. I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one. The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!)

Maybe they'll at least attempt to do more good than harm in the world. @secupp How many Medicaid expansion refusers did he fund? How many politicians who wanted to strip healthcare from millions did he fund?  He could have invested his money in making healthcare more accessible to the poor and working class.  He did the opposite. @secupp At least politicians have to answer to the people. At least when there aren't billionaires actively funding anti-democratic efforts like voter suppression and gerrymandering. Thanks again, Koch Brothers. @secupp I think we'll never agree on the role of government.  You'll always prefer less than I do. I get that. But I'd rather rely on democratically-elected officials than an unaccountable billionaire to set priorities and fund public goods. @JonTrotterEsq @secupp We can all debate the moral implications of everyone's political acts.  Part of your opinion will be based on your own priorities and values.  But let's at least be clear-eyed and examine the facts of what he advocated for and the real-life effects of the policies he championed. @secupp When you work so hard to avoid paying taxes that could go to fund things like education, the arts and infrastructure, spare me the celebration of your donation to the arts. @secupp For instance, when you spend so much to support politicians who want to strip health insurance from people, IDGAF about the money you spend on cancer research.  People without health insurance can't access that amazing research anyway. @secupp I don't celebrate his death. But I most certainly don't celebrate his life. @secupp He spent a decent amount fighting for crim justice reform too.  It's a cause I care about deeply.  People are complicated.  But I have to say that the net effect of the Koch brothers' activism is highly negative and I don't think it's that close of a call. @secupp It's not a lack of attention I'm concerned about. It's active attention towards destructive political aims. @HighArchmage @secupp @MIT @AnandWrites Word. He spends significant time on the Sacklers' story. @secupp @MIT When you spend so much $ and influence to dismantle the state and destroy the planet, it really isn't enough to donate even millions to offset that damage.  @AnandWrites wrote a great book re: this called Winners Take All.  I found it quite illuminating and useful. RT @IdaAuken: Mr President - Greenland is not for sale. But Denmark has a much better deal for you!

But this bill won't pass the GOP Senate and Trump wont sign. How about Dems unilaterally vow to voluntarily follow a certain anti-corruption code even if it's not the law of the land. @jDorai Both parties should. You're right. But the Democrats claim to be the party of the people. GOP makes it clear their main goal is lowering taxes for the rich and deregulating corporations.  Democrats should back up their brand with actions that make it clear who they stand with Democrats should make it their policy to truly drain the swamp. Show that you can't be bought.  Show that you are making policy with no ulterior motives.  Make that a core part of the brand Everybody's retweeting this. But it really is great.

I'm friends with the #SurvivingRKelly director and several protestors in the #MuteRKelly movement so I had a personal connection and agreed to appear. I don't just go around interviewing for every expos\u00e9. This is dumb @tariqnasheed I'm glad you agree with me that R deserves the Weinstein treatment. Believe the victims, expose the rampant predatory behavior, career destruction and indictment with convictions hopefully in the future. @DreMicheals1 Weinstein has been exposed. His career is destroyed, he's ostracized from the business  and will never make a movie again.  He's charged with sexual assault and is awaiting trial. If you want the same for R, then great!  Me too. @BluBell17 We have never collabed. Ever. @BluBell17 Please show me the songs I made with him. Google really hard. They don't exist. If y'all wanna cape for R and discount all these women's stories, just say it. Don't bring up some old pics of me and somebody else. https://t.co/2wus2P7vNm I took a photo with and worked with Harvey on several occasions before his abuse was known to me and the rest of the world.  Since his being exposed, his company and career have rightfully been destroyed and he's been indicted. Sounds like something that should happen to R Kelly https://t.co/LgIOQpEnsP @dh_simba7 @JT_theQB4th Congratulations on a phenomenal season!  On to the next challenge! @mason_patty Love you back!  Just believe that pundits' opinions should represent a wider range of the diversity of the populace.

Great article! @chrissyteigen @GQMagazine the people will decide!! @GQMagazine Unfortunately, it is political, in that it affects our politics and can manifest itself in government decisions.

It is, in part, fueled by the rhetoric of demagogues who scare people about brown people and Jews. Some of those demagogues are on prime time on Fox News, getting ad dollars from mainstream corps @NateSilver538 The logical endpoint of anything moderate could be something extreme. A silly reason to not do that moderate thing. @NateSilver538 Slippery slope arguments are too easy. Executives can make decisions about what kind of speech goes too far and shouldn't be supported by ad dollars.

That is a position of high honor and extreme privilege. He has the right to not be criminally convicted and locked up without convincing evidence. It's a different standard. @Yi_Dav2016 @secupp Well, you could understand him lying about, say, sexually assualting someone. But lying about getting very drunk is ridiculous and unnecessary.  All these beers and underage drinking and you never went too far?  Obvious bullshit. @mikedaitch @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp My belief that the government shouldn't have power over a woman's uterus is very much a moral issue. My belief that a supreme Court Justice shouldn't be a liar and sexual assualter: also moral @TallManShort @US395 @secupp Dr Ford is not absurd and her accusations clearly weren't. Did you watch her testimony? @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp These are the sorts of details the FBI investigates to help flesh out the facts and assess the credibility of the accusations.  GOP doesn't want the investigation because they're afraid of the truth. @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford came forward before Kavanaugh was even picked, when he was on a short list. That timeline is critical. It shows the party wasn't paying or inciting her to come forward. She knew he had integrity issues and didn't want him to be picked from the shortlist. @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp The rape question goes to his credibility, integrity, temperament. It's not a criminal case. There is no beyond a reasonable doubt standard. @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp It is not a criminal prosecution of a rape claim. This is not a rape case. It's a job interview to decide whether or not Kavanaugh should get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. A position that gives him power over all of our lives @US395 @secupp Trump promised he would pick judges that would overturn RvW. He said women should be punished.  And the federalist society is committed to overturning as well.  So are we supposed to believe that Kavanaugh was picked and won't carry out their plan? @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp We dont know the extent of the evidence because the claims haven't been investigated. They should be investigated @DestructiveChem @secupp Real, actual, sentient human beings have said they were victims of Kavanaugh and his cronies. The Democratic party didn't make this up. If you want to call the women liars, just say it. @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford accused him with clarity and credibility. The Democratic party didn't. @DestructiveChem @secupp Are you calling Dr Ford a liar?  Did she make all of this up? @JustMaintain @secupp It's about all of it @secupp And the fact that this person who made all of these \"boys will be boys\" mistakes as a teenager can now have the power to force a teenage girl to carry a pregnancy to term is downright terrifying. @secupp I hate his politics. But I'm also resigned to the fact that a conservative without integrity issues will make it to the court, just like Gorsuch did. Kavanaugh is a terrible choice even among conservatives I clearly disagree with @secupp And I don't think we've ever seen a court nominee display such disdain for the other political party. He obviously can't be even remotely impartial. @secupp He lied about his involvement in Bush policy decisions and judge nomination campaigns. He most likely lied about the extent of his drinking and other things he could have admitted to. He's not to be trusted. @secupp The biggest problem with him is that he's lied multiple times before the senate, sometimes about things he needn't lie about. @JasonBrandon8 So we pick based on who's most qualified now? What does that even mean really Raise your hand if you believe there's even a tiny chance Kavanaugh has never had so much to drink that he didn't remember some of the night's events.  He's obviously a liar. People keep saying it's not in the Constitution. That's why we have amendments.  The Constitution can change.  The founding fathers weren't divine. @raythemaverick I'm saying the Constitution is wrong on this point. I know what it says. I know that it's completely ridiculous in the real world too @Aftermath8 The founding fathers aren't divine. They fucked up on this one, among other things And obviously the senate needs to be dramatically changed.  California's representation vs Wyoming is a travesty I haven't workshopped this but it ain't crazy. It's like best actor and best actress categories. We should have a man and a woman representing each district and state to guarantee 50/50 representation. I believe Dr Ford.

And some humans do really fucked up things. https://t.co/XBiyHNhUQR @elliottpatsy1 Some are education related charities, some that deal with criminal justice reform, some that deal with feeding the poor. @OluwaSirdam When did I support evil?  If we want to prevent evil we need to at least confront the realities that led to it. People don't commit crimes because liberals are too soft to call them animals. @OluwaSirdam We are the product of a bunch of decisions, including plenty of our own.  But we all have parents, neighborhoods, governments, etc. whose decisions help shape our future too. @Beard__Chase no, I'm saying some innocent children grow up to be gang members.  do you dispute this obvious fact? @KentBrockman13 nope.  but they're human. nazis were humans.  kkk members human.  the people who do the absolute worst things are still human.  calling them animals may make us feel better.  doesn't make it true. Dehumanizing large groups of people is the demagogue's precursor to visiting violence and pain upon them. It makes it easier to destroy their families and much worse. And we should particularly interrogate the role of American policy in helping to make MS-13 the organization it is now. But it's much more honest and challenging to realize they were all babies once and think about what in society, their home life, etc took them from baby to violent gang member. And then to think about collective action we could take to mitigate these conditions Even human beings who commit heinous acts are the same species as us, not \"animals\".

But quite odd that he would choose to lecture me on respect for the law. https://t.co/ndCIxzyexI I wonder what makes life more difficult for police. That we have so many guns per capita in America or me being upset when cops get away with murder.

And I'mma retweet this ad because I need a break from this shit https://t.co/m7m4n8rcAE Anyway, y'all need to come to Montgomery and see this memorial The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy.  He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth. They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear Far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist. I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However...
