We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff. Her sentence shouldn't be fewer years. It should be ZERO. It's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. It's insane we locked a woman up for 5 years for sending her kid to the wrong school district.  Literally everyone involved in that decision should be ashamed of themselves Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up.  Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill. I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one. The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!)

This is all just conversation and a way of affirming and critiquing certain behavior and values. I think it's a worthy discussion if it influences people to think about the impact of their actions (in business, politics and philanthropy) on society @maxvan00 @secupp I'm gonna take a hard pass on looking to the 19th century for when America was at its greatest @rootb3er @MeredthSalenger @secupp Different Kochs. Same spelling, different family @PeterFManning3 @secupp He answers to billionaires like....the Kochs! @DWesJr @secupp Cool, bro @pmtisariddle @secupp If I ever run for office, I certainly will.  Still waiting for POTUS's \"audit\" to be over, I assume? @secupp Democracy is most certainly messy and imperfect but depending on the largesse and pet interests of unaccountable oligarchs is a far worse option. @secupp *unaccountable @secupp Trust has to be earned. But at least the people get to vote on politicians every 2-6 years. It'd be nice if those elections were free of unaccounted billionaires tipping the scale. @secupp And I'm pretty sure people have been criticizing him pretty loudly for at least the past decade. @secupp It may not matter, honestly.  But I think a lot of these guys care about their legacy. Maybe the ones who are still alive will see this and do better. Maybe they'll at least attempt to do more good than harm in the world. @secupp How many Medicaid expansion refusers did he fund? How many politicians who wanted to strip healthcare from millions did he fund?  He could have invested his money in making healthcare more accessible to the poor and working class.  He did the opposite. @secupp At least politicians have to answer to the people. At least when there aren't billionaires actively funding anti-democratic efforts like voter suppression and gerrymandering. Thanks again, Koch Brothers. @secupp I think we'll never agree on the role of government.  You'll always prefer less than I do. I get that. But I'd rather rely on democratically-elected officials than an unaccountable billionaire to set priorities and fund public goods. @JonTrotterEsq @secupp We can all debate the moral implications of everyone's political acts.  Part of your opinion will be based on your own priorities and values.  But let's at least be clear-eyed and examine the facts of what he advocated for and the real-life effects of the policies he championed. @secupp When you work so hard to avoid paying taxes that could go to fund things like education, the arts and infrastructure, spare me the celebration of your donation to the arts. @secupp For instance, when you spend so much to support politicians who want to strip health insurance from people, IDGAF about the money you spend on cancer research.  People without health insurance can't access that amazing research anyway. @secupp I don't celebrate his death. But I most certainly don't celebrate his life. @secupp He spent a decent amount fighting for crim justice reform too.  It's a cause I care about deeply.  People are complicated.  But I have to say that the net effect of the Koch brothers' activism is highly negative and I don't think it's that close of a call. @secupp It's not a lack of attention I'm concerned about. It's active attention towards destructive political aims. @HighArchmage @secupp @MIT @AnandWrites Word. He spends significant time on the Sacklers' story. @secupp @MIT When you spend so much $ and influence to dismantle the state and destroy the planet, it really isn't enough to donate even millions to offset that damage.  @AnandWrites wrote a great book re: this called Winners Take All.

But the Democrats claim to be the party of the people. GOP makes it clear their main goal is lowering taxes for the rich and deregulating corporations.  Democrats should back up their brand with actions that make it clear who they stand with Democrats should make it their policy to truly drain the swamp. Show that you can't be bought.

I don't just go around interviewing for every expos\u00e9. This is dumb @tariqnasheed I'm glad you agree with me that R deserves the Weinstein treatment. Believe the victims, expose the rampant predatory behavior, career destruction and indictment with convictions hopefully in the future. @DreMicheals1 Weinstein has been exposed. His career is destroyed, he's ostracized from the business  and will never make a movie again.  He's charged with sexual assault and is awaiting trial. If you want the same for R, then great!  Me too. @BluBell17 We have never collabed. Ever. @BluBell17 Please show me the songs I made with him. Google really hard. They don't exist.

Don't bring up some old pics of me and somebody else. https://t.co/2wus2P7vNm I took a photo with and worked with Harvey on several occasions before his abuse was known to me and the rest of the world.

Some of those demagogues are on prime time on Fox News, getting ad dollars from mainstream corps @NateSilver538 The logical endpoint of anything moderate could be something extreme. A silly reason to not do that moderate thing. @NateSilver538 Slippery slope arguments are too easy.

So are we supposed to believe that Kavanaugh was picked and won't carry out their plan? @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp We dont know the extent of the evidence because the claims haven't been investigated. They should be investigated @DestructiveChem @secupp Real, actual, sentient human beings have said they were victims of Kavanaugh and his cronies. The Democratic party didn't make this up. If you want to call the women liars, just say it. @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford accused him with clarity and credibility. The Democratic party didn't. @DestructiveChem @secupp Are you calling Dr Ford a liar?  Did she make all of this up? @JustMaintain @secupp It's about all of it @secupp And the fact that this person who made all of these \"boys will be boys\" mistakes as a teenager can now have the power to force a teenage girl to carry a pregnancy to term is downright terrifying. @secupp I hate his politics. But I'm also resigned to the fact that a conservative without integrity issues will make it to the court, just like Gorsuch did. Kavanaugh is a terrible choice even among conservatives I clearly disagree with @secupp And I don't think we've ever seen a court nominee display such disdain for the other political party. He obviously can't be even remotely impartial. @secupp He lied about his involvement in Bush policy decisions and judge nomination campaigns. He most likely lied about the extent of his drinking and other things he could have admitted to. He's not to be trusted. @secupp The biggest problem with him is that he's lied multiple times before the senate, sometimes about things he needn't lie about. @JasonBrandon8 So we pick based on who's most qualified now? What does that even mean really Raise your hand if you believe there's even a tiny chance Kavanaugh has never had so much to drink that he didn't remember some of the night's events.  He's obviously a liar. People keep saying it's not in the Constitution. That's why we have amendments.  The Constitution can change.  The founding fathers weren't divine. @raythemaverick I'm saying the Constitution is wrong on this point. I know what it says. I know that it's completely ridiculous in the real world too @Aftermath8 The founding fathers aren't divine. They fucked up on this one, among other things And obviously the senate needs to be dramatically changed.  California's representation vs Wyoming is a travesty I haven't workshopped this but it ain't crazy. It's like best actor and best actress categories. We should have a man and a woman representing each district and state to guarantee 50/50 representation. I believe Dr Ford.

I'm still not related to THAT Arthur @BrooklynDecker We were watching it in the labor and delivery room haha. Too funny and too real. A whole lot of Americans' ancestors brutally enslaved, beat, lynched and raped my ancestors. A lot of the same folks quick to call other folks animals.  What does that make you?  The answer is that we're all human. And some humans do really fucked up things. https://t.co/XBiyHNhUQR @elliottpatsy1 Some are education related charities, some that deal with criminal justice reform, some that deal with feeding the poor. @OluwaSirdam When did I support evil?  If we want to prevent evil we need to at least confront the realities that led to it. People don't commit crimes because liberals are too soft to call them animals. @OluwaSirdam We are the product of a bunch of decisions, including plenty of our own.  But we all have parents, neighborhoods, governments, etc. whose decisions help shape our future too. @Beard__Chase no, I'm saying some innocent children grow up to be gang members.  do you dispute this obvious fact? @KentBrockman13 nope.  but they're human. nazis were humans.  kkk members human.  the people who do the absolute worst things are still human.  calling them animals may make us feel better.  doesn't make it true. Dehumanizing large groups of people is the demagogue's precursor to visiting violence and pain upon them. It makes it easier to destroy their families and much worse. And we should particularly interrogate the role of American policy in helping to make MS-13 the organization it is now. But it's much more honest and challenging to realize they were all babies once and think about what in society, their home life, etc took them from baby to violent gang member. And then to think about collective action we could take to mitigate these conditions Even human beings who commit heinous acts are the same species as us, not \"animals\". I'm in the hospital with our new son. Any of these babies here could end up committing terrible crimes in the future.

And then all the segregationists and their ideological descendants eventually became Republicans!  The solid south of the Democratic party became the solid south of the Republicans. White southern vote is almost exclusively GOP. Facts bruh. But the party claiming to be the party of Lincoln is living in the present?

But Trump led with bigotry and made it a core of his campaign @ShellieMac52 No I didn't. I didn't agree with a lot of Bush's policies but Trump led with bigotry and made it a core theme of his campaign. Bush did not. Co-sign. https://t.co/Sm8TdmDfRv @SusanDV True. True.

You can show me all the individuals you want. I'm sure they are wonderful people. The NRA's agenda is to sell more guns and stop any meaningful gun safety measures. You are a danger to America. You are a danger to law enforcement. https://t.co/yIAbotNU8i and it was FANTASTIC https://t.co/EY85FWxktO We did not, however, talk about my new single.  Did I mention I had a new single?  haha. #AGoodNight We discussed the infamous text exchange, why policy matters, why black people tend to vote for Democrats, the history behind our party loyalty (hint:  we ain't slaves), and how we can remember our history and still be fly. Had an excellent conversation with my brother @ebrointheAM!  Listen to all of it here!  https://t.co/WxCZ5bGEBm @BernardKerik @majority4_trump @NRA Police in nations without our addiction to guns almost never have to worry about being shot. And they rarely resort to shooting civilians. The NRA's only mission is to sell more guns. They are dangerous to police. Spent an amazing evening with Kiehl\u2019s celebrating the launch of their sustainability platform last night! Follow @Kiehls and #KiehlsMadeBetter to find out more soon. #KiehlsPartner https://t.co/n5HjDCPAGK Just like Trump to slap his name on something someone else built and take credit for it. I know fact free thought is a major pillar of maga but here's a little chart showing how black unemployment went down dramatically under Obama (after Dubya's financial meltdown) and has continued going down a little under Trump. So we do thank our President Obama for this! https://t.co/Nl0ySJkUt4 Based on the flood of maga in my mentions, they think Trump saved America's economy. And that black folks, in particular, should be grateful to our racist president for our low unemployment rate Hope to see you as Georgia's next governor! https://t.co/4MEiwa8jVP I believe in redemption for the formerly incarcerated. But quite odd that he would choose to lecture me on respect for the law. https://t.co/ndCIxzyexI I wonder what makes life more difficult for police. That we have so many guns per capita in America or me being upset when cops get away with murder.  The NRA is a danger to this nation and to the police. https://t.co/dn1NfFLhIP @beaburns @kanyewest @chrissyteigen Google Pixel @jfreewright Well deserved, brother!

And I'mma retweet this ad because I need a break from this shit https://t.co/m7m4n8rcAE Anyway, y'all need to come to Montgomery and see this memorial The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy.  He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth. They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear Far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist. I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However...
